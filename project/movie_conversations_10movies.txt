You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...
We'll all go crazy...
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
IFGODWILLSIT!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.
Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
Chief says how many?
Thousands.
Why?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Surely you can do anything you want.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here. I have your money.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I'm abused. Don't you think?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
I can't take you to my place.
Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Right.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?
Pouring it out!
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Chief mind if I take her?
Okay. But not water sports.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
You ready?
What's he looking for?
A timer.
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.
It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here make yourself useful.
Are you hit?
No. I'm okay.
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good. Good. Commendable.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
Two heads.
Better than one.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Why not?
Something back home?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Raw deal.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
Detective can you tell us what happened here?
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey, honey.
Hey.
So what's unique?
Not what. Who.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Any chance we can do that again?
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Are you married?
No. Are you proposing?
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
Get down on your knees.
Where's your partner?
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Give me the address!!
Alright, alright don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
Yes sir.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have fivehundred dollars.
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
Who is he?
New York's finest. This is his case.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Did you hear what I said?
I want to document my trip to America.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
We have no money. Come on.
What?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
Whore?
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
Don't want to film this?
What is that?
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
Cut!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
I'm serious.
Shut up. Look!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Be quiet. Watch.
Traitor!!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Emil???!
Surprise! Surprise!
Viewer discretion advised!
You want the tape? There it is!
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
In love? With who?
Yeah?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
No. Go ahead.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
What was that?
Evidence. Of a homicide.
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah? Guess again.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils burn 'em out. Let it run.
But you knew that, right?
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
How was it?
Not good.
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
Yeah?
I want to pick up my car.
Name?
Hammond.
This is three years old.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here's hoping, baby...
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Where's ganz?
In the back. Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Where's the money?
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a towaway zone.
You just drove by it.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
No way...
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?
What about Ganz?
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
It's late, they're closing...
Don't worry about it.
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah, I read the report...
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Shit.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Bullshit red tape.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack? What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
You real down?
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.
Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
You're impossible...
That's what I always say.
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Hey...
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Shut up.
Stall.
What do you want?
Keep stallin'.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they?
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Let her go.
First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?
Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?
Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
CorniLius?
At your service.
What're you laughing about?
Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
Iksetkiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!
You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!
I'm fucked!
You are a monster, Zorg!
I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
What are you doing?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Is there anything that can stop it?
Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
What are we going to do?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
They really made her...
Perfect.
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
They are... with me...
Yeah?
Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
Like shit.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Leeloo..
Akina delutan, noushan.
...'Scuse me?
Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Priest...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito... Cor... Nilious... Priest...
Vito Cornelius?
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai LekararibaLaminaiTchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
The Fifth Element...
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
We will be ready, Lord.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Yes ma..
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
I'm sorry..
This is a police control action..
30 seconds...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6... 5...
Found it?
...Hi.
Does it get any better or what!
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Got it...
Six to the left. One to the right.
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Not without Leeloo.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I'll be right back.
You know how to fly this thing?
It's like a cab isn't it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Is that all?
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
...Shit!
What is it?
Apipoulai!
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Uh..you're welcome.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Apipoulai!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Love...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
OK, you can turn around!
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
You're nothing but a... a...
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
Tell me...
I love you...
The cash man!
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
It's not?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Thanks..
You're welcome..
This thing solid?
An elephant couldn't crack it.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
TheStones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
I want your best man on this!
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
They just landed in the desert.
How much time is left?
Staedert, do you read me?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy..
Drink!
To fame.. salud..
Am I disturbing you?
No... not at all. Where are you?
...Not far, now.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
...I can't wait to be among you.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
I'm okay.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.
Got you for 450, 500 bucks?
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Shit.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Lillian!
Where's Jill?
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.
Wade.
What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.
Can ?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
How's that?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Just do it.
Attago.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
You nogood pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
Where's Ma?
She's coming.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
For what?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jetlagged. We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom?
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Hey, you guys back already?
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice!
Daddy...
Daddy...
Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie?
Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
It's cut.
cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails.
This doesn't make sense.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, this is AF135RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Roger.
That's affirmative.
Ga get it.
We've already been inspected.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Now, or he dies, please.
Come on, Alice.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...
Jim...
Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
One thing I've learned as
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Hold on, Alice.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
I'll not going without my family.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.
That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
How did your speech go?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.
Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
Both of you.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it?
White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
One.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.
That's my job.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.
Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twentyfive years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of prelaunch testing.
Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
What?
I just wish it was that simple.
Forget it. I was reading.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Oveur.
Dunn.
Shut down accelerators.
Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn.
Sir?
You better take this.
Elaine.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ask Simon.
Elaine.
Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
Ted! What are you...?
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!
Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted?
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
I mean until we start to burn up.
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
Set!
Now!
Compute!
Ted, the lever!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Yes last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine. I know where I'm coming from on this.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
You have great tits.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
Just poached on toast. Over.
That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Poached! Not over! Over!
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Now he's DYINGing and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door. The door's over there.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
No. It's hard to LAUGH when your father's dying.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! And stop calling me Shirley!
Captain, how soon can we land?
I can't tell.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?
He had fish.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know now I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?
Uhhuh.
We have a visitor.
Hello.
We'd better get back now.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Who wants to be first?
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Every day.
Goodbye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Goodbye, Bill.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
He's right on the heading.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it.
What is it?
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Hi!
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
I will, but Jim won't.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Of course.
FourteenB. It's halfway down on your right.
Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Oh I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
No. No thank you.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
You okay?
Yeah...
You are Cassandra?
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
He's not here. Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she? Well, she was wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.
In there.
Show me.
William Harcourt?
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Sergeant... Detective. I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
No, Sergeant not history... Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Kill them both.
Here?
Do it!
What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
And still it fits?
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Who said that?
At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
