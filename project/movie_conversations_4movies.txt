Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad. Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring samesex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
No
Okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Combination. I don't know I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
You did what?
Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastrointestinal display
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, I
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night
The prom? Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl I
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shiteating grin?
Joey Dorsey? Permashitgrin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly Alist. With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
Hey I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice? Besides when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indierock persuasion".
So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his maledominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You covered in my vomit.
Seventhirty?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
My grandmother's .
What?
That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone my grandfather died I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out! By the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a setup!
It wasn't like that.
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're fortyfive and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Just smack her now.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you're such a fuckup?
Well, you know there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...
We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered blackskinned people. I, too, will find other populations and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
IFGODWILLSIT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.
Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...
Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
What is it, now? Tell me...
I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...
No?
NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...? Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
You come! You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort.
Chief says how many?
Thousands.
Why?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
Colon!
Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh? So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right. Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vicepresident and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your exwife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twentyfive hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's soninlaw and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gutshoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Wonderful!
I'm okay.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.
Got you for 450, 500 bucks?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Not here.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. Er
Evan. He's a muckymuck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a fullblown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Shit.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Piece of fucking cake.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
There's your old twentygauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
He sure as hell won't.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I'm sorry for the screwup. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trickortreating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trickor treating. They're still out.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
You can't.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His soninlaw damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's fatherinlaw shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!
Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand
From Boston. Evan Twombley's sonin law he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grownup person.
It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing just now?
I'm her father supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.
Wade.
What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.
Can ?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
Take care, Wade.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right.
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Marg!
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Marg! You got orders!
You talked to Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Kerbang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Rolfe.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!
Just do it.
Attago.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
You nogood pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
Where's Ma?
She's coming.
Yeah.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You! By Christ, you I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nahnahnaw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck stolen!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his soninlaw who's vicepresident and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his soninlaw is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own fatherinlaw, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset one thing on top of another.
Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
For what?
To help, Jack, of course and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I said something.
I know you did!
No, not her. Me.
Who's you?
My name is AL.
Al ???!!!
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
What's going on?
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Don't do that.
Why not.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
You're in my head...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I see...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Shut up!
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Quit screwing around, this is important.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
You've heard of the PEM114...
That a new Datsun?
Are you threatening me?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Me? What'd I do?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
I know...it sounds insane.
You said it.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Don't do it. Don't aim at the head.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
You'll be alive.
With a man in my head...
Yeah.
What was that?
Who was that? Somebody out there?
You weren't listening!
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why don't you?
No they won't.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Anyone there?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Behind us?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
What's that?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
What'd he look like?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
What do I do?
Outrun them.
This is a Fiesta!
Now what?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
I wouldn't say that.
Then what are you stopping for?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Calm Down! Act rational.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I don't know...To get Al.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Did you hear that?
Yeah. Al wants to talk to you!
It can't take that long.
Why?
JOE Or what?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
They could put you back in the tube..
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head. ...We'll have to do it on our own.
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Find You?
I'm not gonna make it easy.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Sue them.
I'll sue.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
Where are we going?
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
The man.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
I can't remember..
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Gone where?
Don't know.
You need ID in there?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Nothing!
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
Who is it?
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
What is it?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What do we do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You are not alone. But you are incon picuous...and, with our abilities...
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about money?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
...and a license to kill...
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
They'll know who I am.
We'll change your appearance.
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You leave my glands alone!
Now what?
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?
Just get there.
Holy shit!
What is it?
...Just beautiful.
Do you notice anything.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Swim.
Good Idea!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Little late for that.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Now what?
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Where are you going? Wait!
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Beautiful!
What was?
A girl.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Follow it.
She's...pretty fast.
You're out of shape.
What is it?
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
Help me out, will you?
What can I do? You're on your own.
What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
.
Wait.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Where are you staying?
Touch her.
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
...Joe.
No...you idiot!
What happened?
...Rene...
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
It worked.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Well you did it today.
Yeah. I did it.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Now, where would I be?
What are you looking at?
But what's it look like?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Is something glinting?
What is it?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
You really like that shirt?
This...is not going to work out.
Much too blue.
Not blue enough.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Not that tie with that coat.
Why not?!
What did that cost?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Doesn't.
Which one is she?
The beautiful one.
They both look good to me.
You have no taste.
Get close to them.
That place. By the window.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Who, me?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
That's a big if.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
What glasses.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Follow that busboy.
Are you serious?
I feel like an idiot.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
He recognises you, throw him off.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Don't get too cute.
Joe, be careful!
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
It's embarrassing.
What if she says something important?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
What Happened?
I don't know!
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Is that all?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
She's got the most beautiful...s
Shit! You're in love.
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You get time off to sleep.
No. What do you hope? AL I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
No. What will you do.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
You been had. We have.
It wasn't like that.
Some agent you are.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of HighTech.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
Come on, she's getting away.
I can't keep up.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
That's not funny.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Don't touch a thing.
Don't worry!
...drink it.
Too late.
What next!
Drink lots of water.
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
What are you doing?
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take and .
Ow!
A hard left. A hard left.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
He was with Gruner!
You were with GRUNER!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
No. You can't trust her.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Probably.
I don't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
It's him.
Come on.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
You sure this will work?
Not sure at all.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
What was it? What'd I say?
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Well...?
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
Where?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Do it.
I can't handle that thing.
Don't worry, I can.
Are you alright?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim just in front of his face.
Aim what?
Holy...
...Shit! It's just money.
He aready made the deal..
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Dieter!
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
There's a lot you don't know.
And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverseengineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Do something.
What exactly?
I don't know.
What happened?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
Looks like you can have all you want.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Rene?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
She is beautiful.
You've changed your mind.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Oh no!
I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
They can?
You're a lucky man.
Yeah, sure.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
You're lovely.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Awwww...
I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
That's nice.
What are you doing?
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
GOTOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.
JOE What abilities...?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
You just got a Mickey.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Not that truth!
Aren't we all.
Sorry...
It'll remind me of you.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
Do what? What'd you do?
What is your name?
Don't give her your name.
No!
Oh, I can't.
Good.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Dieter?
I'm against it.
I insist.
Can you fly this?
Don't worry.
I'm...scared.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I didn't do anything.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Nice?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
I knew you were trouble.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
They have stolen state property.
What a nerve!
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Rene?
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
Impossible.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Who's our little man?
Me.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control reenlargement, from inside.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Then how did you know?
You've cut your hair?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
PEM115!
**?!!
Newer, more powerful design.
How about a deal?
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
We'll have to let them go.
Surveilliance on them all.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
He work for us?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
What Job?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
Join us.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
It's just money.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
I don't want to intrude.
We insist.
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
...Foreign service.
And how do you service foreigners.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
What brings you here?
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
I think I've heard of you.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
I will?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I don't know Who.
Al?
The little man in my... ...head...
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Sue who?
You...him...UST.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
I noticed you staring.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
A little voice in my head.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Sir?
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Now you know what I know.
Sir?
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
The fresh tuna?..
Yessir...very good sir.
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said something first.
Oh...and who is it!?
I didn't say anything.
What do you do about what?
...I'm looking for someone.
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
...Blake
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Yes?
Blake said that?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
And you.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
What's so funny?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
What way?
Like there's someone else here.
Wait. What's your name?
...Rene.
You mean from it.
Yes, of course.
And you?
I just work for the travel firm.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...I...don't know.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Are you alright?
Promise you what?
That you're not crazy.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
Just Okay...
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
That depends...
Joe! What happened to you?
Why'd you run off?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
You did.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
You know where he went?
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
Got to trust someone.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
You think I'm like that?
What's Gruner like?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And you?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Where we going?
Beats me.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pickup, a rendezvous.
Then where's the chip.
What?
He plays it all the time.
Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Get us one.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Where what?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
What?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I asked him.
Oh.
Why'd you ask him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
What?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've been there?
I know the territory.
You coming along?
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Why not?
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
