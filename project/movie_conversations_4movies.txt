You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...
We'll all go crazy...
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
IFGODWILLSIT!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.
Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
Chief says how many?
Thousands.
Why?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Surely you can do anything you want.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here. I have your money.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I'm abused. Don't you think?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
I can't take you to my place.
Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Right.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?
Pouring it out!
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Chief mind if I take her?
Okay. But not water sports.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
You ready?
What's he looking for?
A timer.
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.
It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here make yourself useful.
Are you hit?
No. I'm okay.
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good. Good. Commendable.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
Two heads.
Better than one.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Why not?
Something back home?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Raw deal.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
Detective can you tell us what happened here?
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey, honey.
Hey.
So what's unique?
Not what. Who.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Any chance we can do that again?
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Are you married?
No. Are you proposing?
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
Get down on your knees.
Where's your partner?
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Give me the address!!
Alright, alright don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
Yes sir.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have fivehundred dollars.
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
Who is he?
New York's finest. This is his case.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Did you hear what I said?
I want to document my trip to America.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
We have no money. Come on.
What?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
Whore?
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
Don't want to film this?
What is that?
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
Cut!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
I'm serious.
Shut up. Look!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Be quiet. Watch.
Traitor!!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Emil???!

Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

Here's hoping, baby...
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Where's ganz?
In the back. Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Where's the money?
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a towaway zone.
You just drove by it.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
No way...
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?
What about Ganz?
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
It's late, they're closing...
Don't worry about it.
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah, I read the report...
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Shit.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Bullshit red tape.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack? What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
You real down?

First, the money.

What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?
Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?
Naw, right here's okay.
