You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
