You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine.
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No impressed.
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...
We'll all go crazy...
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
IFGODWILLSIT!
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.
Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
Chief says how many?
Thousands.
Why?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Surely you can do anything you want.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here. I have your money.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I'm abused. Don't you think?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
I can't take you to my place.
Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Right.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?
Pouring it out!
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Chief mind if I take her?
Okay. But not water sports.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
You ready?
What's he looking for?
A timer.
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.
It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here make yourself useful.
Are you hit?
No. I'm okay.
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good. Good. Commendable.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
Two heads.
Better than one.
Leon meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Why not?
Something back home?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Raw deal.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Good be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
Detective can you tell us what happened here?
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey, honey.
Hey.
Hi, what's up?
Not what. Who.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay. You ready?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Any chance we can do that again?
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Are you married?
No. Are you proposing?
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
What? It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film I'll call another show. And they will show it.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
Get down on your knees.
Where's your partner?
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go! Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Give me the address!!
Alright, alright don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
Yes sir.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have fivehundred dollars.
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
Who is he?
New York's finest. This is his case.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Did you hear what I said?
I want to document my trip to America.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
We have no money. Come on.
What?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
Whore?
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
Don't want to film this?
What is it?
The video of Milos and Tamina I told you to erase it.
I did.
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What is that?
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
Cut!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
I'm serious.
Shut up. Look!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Be quiet. Watch.
Traitor!!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Emil???!
Surprise! Surprise!
Viewer discretion advised!
You want the tape? There it is!
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
In love? With who?
Yeah?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Yes...he's my friend.
Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
No. Go ahead.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
What was that?
Evidence. Of a homicide.
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah? Guess again.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
Naw I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils burn 'em out. Let it run.
But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
He knew all along.
What??
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
How was it?
Not good.
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
SPACE STATTION 5 LOUNGE
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED
She's wonderful.
CONTINUED
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official upgrading to AGS19 two weeks before we left.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AOunit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other wise we're out of business.
Hal?
Yes.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventytwo hours.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AOunits that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
CONTINUED
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED
Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED
Well, what is it?
CONINUED
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, surveymarker spare part, take your choice.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Roger.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Opening pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Yeah?
I want to pick up my car.
Name?
Hammond.
This is three years old.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here's hoping, baby...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Where's ganz?
In the back. Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Where's the money?
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a towaway zone.
You just drove by it.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
No way...
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?
What about Ganz?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
It's late, they're closing...
Don't worry about it.
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
You okay?
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah, I read the report...
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Shit.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Bullshit red tape.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot. That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
What?
Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack? What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't. We've had a hard night.
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.
Whaddya think?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
You're impossible...
That's what I always say.
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Hey...
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Shut up.
Stall.
What do you want?
Keep stallin'.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they?
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Let her go.
First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?
Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?
Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five. On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
CorniLius?
At your service.
What're you laughing about?
Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
Iksetkiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!
You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!
I'm fucked!
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
You are a monster, Zorg!
I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
What are you doing?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.
Is there anything that can stop it?
Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
What are we going to do?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Yes. Of course..
They really made her...
Perfect.
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...

The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
They are... with me...
Yeah?
Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million I just want one. A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
Like shit.
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Leeloo..
Akina delutan, noushan.
...'Scuse me?
Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Priest...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito... Cor... Nilious... Priest...
Vito Cornelius?
Eto Akta Gamat!
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai LekararibaLaminaiTchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
The Fifth Element...
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
We will be ready, Lord.
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Yes ma..
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Yeah?
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
I'm sorry..
This is a police control action..
30 seconds...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6... 5...
Found it?
...Hi.
Does it get any better or what!
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Got it...
Six to the left. One to the right.
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Not without Leeloo.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I'll be right back.
You know how to fly this thing?
It's like a cab isn't it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Is that all?
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
...Shit!
What is it?
Apipoulai!
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Uh..you're welcome.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Apipoulai!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Love...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
What is... Make Love?
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Goodbye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppihoppa.
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
OK, you can turn around!
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
You're nothing but a... a...
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
Tell me...
I love you...
At least I won lunch.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
The cash man!
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
It's not?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Thanks..
You're welcome..
This thing solid?
An elephant couldn't crack it.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
TheStones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
I want your best man on this!
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
They just landed in the desert.
How much time is left?
Staedert, do you read me?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy..
Drink!
To fame.. salud..
Am I disturbing you?
No... not at all. Where are you?
...Not far, now.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
...I can't wait to be among you.
Welcome home.
Do you know how much I missed you?
How's the detective business?
Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure. I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Hello?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
Tom? Where have you been... ?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
Tom...
It has to be this way for now. It won't be long.
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know. I'm sorry...
You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
I just talked to her.
What are these?
Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What the fuck... !
I promised him to Machine.
It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
What can I do for you today?
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
You said something about money.
Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
He's in. It will be his pleasure.
Where's that?
Brooklyn. Don't be late.
You brought the money?
Right here.
Excellent.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
What are these for?
Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I remember him.
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
Is that him?
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
... sorry...
First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
You betrayed us.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
What's he talking about?
One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Don't ask questions.
Fuck you!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Why?
Because we're going there.
You almost went over your limit.
Fuck you.
Give me the film.
You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.
Go ahead, shoot me. Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Catchy title. What are you really reading? Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Remember me?
Came back for that batteryoperated vagina, right? Told you you would.
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Good for you.
... Hello... ?
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Great.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ?
Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
You don't need to be here.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
What's this?
It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I try to be.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Thank you.
He's odd.
He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Okay...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
How will I get it to you?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes... ?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
Of course.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
Okay.
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes. I remember her.
Do you know what happened to her?
I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Cash.
Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
Okay. Fine.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he ?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re place the Skipper?
What is it?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not ?
Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
They're so remote cold beautiful, the stars. But now I wonder
Yes?
Which is the one we have to worry about?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Cyclops?
Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We're stuck tight!
Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Yeah?
Listen! Hear that?
Hey you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
You know it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better I'd swear we were moving!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?
The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
Well?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Oh it does???
Dave !
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What ?
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
Course and speed?
Speed...about twentytwo knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What???
What course, Skipper?
Right at our oneeyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
What????
We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl! Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Now they feel it...down below.
Radiation level...constantly rising...
It doesn't seem possible, but could it be an electrical storm center ?
Under <u>water</u>?
Highintensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting ?
The radiation level from the saucer it's rising!
What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
It'll be all right. We're old friends!
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
After torpedo room: Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Take a look.
What's the running time?
Thirtyfour seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Straight to the Pole at almost fifty knots!
Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here alone!
Come where?
Swell!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!
I am afraid not. Therefore
It is a living thing. When damaged you would say 'wounded' it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Of course. But it is time to be gin the return voyage
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Thank you.
Well, I'll be !
I'll be another!
We've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times.
But <u>answers</u> are what we need not more questions!
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
All right go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
I'm okay.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.
Got you for 450, 500 bucks?
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Shit.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Lillian!
Where's Jill?
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.
Wade.
What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.
Can ?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
How's that?
Take care, Wade.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Just do it.
Attago.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
You nogood pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
Where's Ma?
She's coming.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
For what?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jetlagged. We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom?
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Hey, you guys back already?
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice!
Daddy...
Daddy...
Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie?
Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
It's cut.
cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails.
This doesn't make sense.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, this is AF135RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Roger.
That's affirmative.
Ga get it.
We've already been inspected.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
And all these rooms here?
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Now, or he dies, please.
Come on, Alice.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...
Jim...
Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Hold on, Alice.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
I'll not going without my family.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.
That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
How did your speech go?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.
Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
Both of you.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it?
White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
One.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.
That's my job.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.
Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twentyfive years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of prelaunch testing.
Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
What?
I just wish it was that simple.
Forget it. I was reading.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Oveur.
Dunn.
Shut down accelerators.
Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn.
Sir?
You better take this.
Elaine.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ask Simon.
Elaine.
Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
Ted! What are you...?
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!
Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted?
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
Set!
Now!
Compute!
Ted, the lever!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Yes last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
Maybe.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine. I know where I'm coming from on this.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
You have great tits.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
Just poached on toast. Over.
That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
Poached! Not over! Over!
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
That's how dry cleaning works. Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Yes, sir, commander. This is Mercury One. Everything seems A okay up here and ready for countdown.
You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Now he's DYINGing and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door. The door's over there.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
You've been hurt.
I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse.
No. It's hard to LAUGH when your father's dying.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! And stop calling me Shirley!
Captain, how soon can we land?
I can't tell.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
That's right.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Yes. Yes, of course.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?
He had fish.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know now I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?
Uhhuh.
We have a visitor.
Hello.
We'd better get back now.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Who wants to be first?
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Every day.
Goodbye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Goodbye, Bill.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
He's right on the heading.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it.
What is it?
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Hi!
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
I will, but Jim won't.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Of course.
FourteenB. It's halfway down on your right.
Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Oh I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
No. No thank you.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
You okay?
Yeah...
You are Cassandra?
That's right.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
He's not here. Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she? Well, she was wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.
In there.
Show me.
William Harcourt?
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Sergeant... Detective. I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
No, Sergeant not history... Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Kill them both.
Here?
Do it!
Let's talk Hubley.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest. Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Nice signal, dickwad!
What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
And still it fits?
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Who said that?
At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I .
I'll handle it.
Screw you.
Screw me? That can't be right.
Matthew, you don't have to .
Stay back! I'm okay.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother? That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Yeah, that's it. Say it slow.
Who is he?
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb sonofabitch.
When will Strader return?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
My wife? She worries about me.
Your home is quite disordered. I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Your health...
Ta ss'trakyona'...
I'm going home.
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
Stop the car.
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stop the car!
What was that about?
Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... and Porter ran a piece of shit momandpop minimart. So what the hell's the connection?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop this without you.
Uh, George...
Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
Shit!
Ssai!
What's this about, George? I know that look.
There! Go back. Down that side street.
No! We must do this alone.
Do what?! George ?!
How do I look?
You look very good.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Sure. Just a minute.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
What's that?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.
What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Did he find anything?
Yeah, Sykes?
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
It is.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Yeah, that's comforting. Mine, too.
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
I got him. Don't get pinned.
Get outta there!
I can't! Do you mind!
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
This floor's freezing.
Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Movement!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
Awright. Fireteam A. Gear up. Let's move. Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Okay, let's do it.
Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.
Flameunits only. I want rifles slung.
Let's go. Pull 'em out.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY! TWENTYSIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley...
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop.
Well, thanks, I
Have they located my daughter yet?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Is she...?
Amanda RipleyMcClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixtysix ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.
Amy.
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children.
You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I hope you're right. I really do.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Still nothing from the colony?
Dead on all channels.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
It's insured.
What's he scanning for?
PDT'S. PersonalData Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Thirtyeight...simulated.
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
The structure seems intact. They have power.
One of us?
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in DBlock?
Where are your parents? You have to try...
Gorman! Give it a rest would you.
What is it?
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So? So?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
Shut up. Just shut up!
I told them to fall back...
They're but off! Do something!
How do you feel?
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
Forget it.
Are there any questions? Hudson?
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
Sir, the CPU is online.
Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go.
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
You tell me. I only work here.
Save it.
Sure, Hicks.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Not that tunnel, the other one!
We got problems.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
The corner! Ready?
Do it!
Seventeen meters.
Let's get these things lit.
Well you're not reading it right!
Six meters. Five. What the fu
Let's go! Let's go!
Fuckin' A!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
About seventeen days.
They're in the approach corridor.
On my way.
Now many?
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Yeah. I've noticed.
It's game time.
Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations.
Locked.
Stand back.
No! No! She's alive! We have to
All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!
Hicks, don't let him leave.
We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
No. Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
Anytime. Anywhere.
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Looks like it stung him.
Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Thanks.
Uh, what's next?
They cut the power.
What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Just get back here!
Range twenty meters.
Seal the door.
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters.
They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
Nine meters. Eight.
Can't be. That's inside the room!
It's readin' right. Look!
And how are we today?
Terrible.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say?
Newt. My nname's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey. She's my only friend.
What about me?
They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would.
They're dead.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
Newt. Newt, wake up.
Wah...? Where are...?
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
I know, honey. Me too.
Burke! Open the door!
Look!
Come on. Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure. Go left.
This way. Come on, we're almost there!
Newt, wait!
I knew you'd come.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
Mommy...Mommy?
Right here, baby. Right here.
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
Look, I told you...
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Certainly!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
His Grace is very angry with you.
What do you mean?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
Perhaps.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you didn't like it.
Oh excuse me!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
What is it?
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
No! No! No!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen don't you know where you are?
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Fartsbishop!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
TishI'm tee. What's that?
What?
TishI'mtee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my ah!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Of course.
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, damn!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Who was that?
No one.
I heard voices.
What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
You'd think I was mad.
No. Don't answer it!
Why?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Why not?
It's killing me.
Excellency!
Madame. How can I help you?
These are originals?
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It is miraculous.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
And I'm asking you
This is not his handwriting.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Adorable!
Behold!
Behold!
Hey!
Hey!
Behold!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
I said play!
Michael!
What a strange young man.
Yes. He is a little strange.
Really?
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Thank you, Madame. Come on now courage. Play me something you know.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Majesty.
Aflat, Majesty.
Ahha!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Your Highness.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them.
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count OrsiniRosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Majesty!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Why so?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Yes, where?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Ahha.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
I think so, Sire, yes.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Enchanted, Madame.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Well Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twentysix.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Thank you, Sire!
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Yes, sir.
Well. There it is.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Ahha. Well. There it is. Good.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
What's that?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
No, really!
This is just a game, Papa.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa, is this your idea?
Mine?
Are you playing a trick on me?
I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Ahha! Siena macaroons my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
I will, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Bene.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Yes what?
Where does he work?
In there, sir.
Sssh!
StanziManziBanziWanzi!
Sssh! Stay here.
What did he say? What did he say?
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Well, we can.
So let me see it. Where is it?
I'm afraid I am.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Love, Sire!
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
But this is absurd!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but Salieri!
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How much?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Are you neglecting my request?
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece the best I ever can!
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
What man?
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
So now A minor. Suddenly.
The Fire.
What time?
Common time.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
And that's all?
Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison ostinato on all like this.
Do you have me?
I think so.
Show me.
And that's it. Do you have it?
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Yes.
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning now!
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
But, Your Majesty
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Herr Mozart
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Baron!
Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
Do you hear me?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Italian?
You mean that play?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
You must be mad.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
The Emperor has given him permission.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well done, Sire!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Did we?
Here I am, my angel.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
That lady is back, sir.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection truly!
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Did he say a wolf?
Yes, I believe he did.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
He's here.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
What shall we do?
Tea would be nice.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
David?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Will you give me a break?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I'm a werewolf.
A werewolf?
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
The kitchen.
Very nice.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Good.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
That's good, Alex. Reassure me.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
A doper werewolf.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
See you later.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I'm freezing.
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
But...
Pull over.
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, stop!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Jack is dead!
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Will you shut up!?!!
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
David, let's go now.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
I thought not.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Now see here young man.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Who is this girl?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
That's easy for you to say you're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Why are you doing this to me?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
No, but we're about to.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
You could have told them!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
I was having a nightmare.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Good.
Jack.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Right.
Hello.
Nice to see you.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
What about it?
It's a fivepointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Go on, ask them.
You ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Apparently so.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Say, David...
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
What was it?
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Yeah.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's moving.
It's circling us.
What's the plan?
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
It's in front of us.
Do you think it's a dog?
Oh shit. What is that?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Walk away, Jack.
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
See anything?
No.
It sounds far away.
Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
You really scared me, you shithead.
Are you going to help me up?
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
You're not real.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Hi, Jack.
Hi, David.
Because this must be stopped.
How shall I do it?
I could hang myself.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Dr. Hirsch?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
What can we do to assist you?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Do you have any hot soup?
No.
Hot chocolate?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Remember the Alamo?
I beg your pardon?
No, thank you.
I'd like some tea, please.
Sorry.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Hello, Tom.
You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Why not?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes sure�
Yeah sure!
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How much?
About twentyfour thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Here's twentyfive thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Yeah?
Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Aw, nerts!
Where you been?
Where do you think I've been? I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Take it easy, Clark.
We want to talk to you.
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
All right, Jack, all right.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Gambling I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
I haven't got it.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I�
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You don't have to do nothing.
Dude there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but�
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Why, I needed a�
Doesn't that come next?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
See, we're getting along famously!
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Why, Matt!
What are you doing here?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Yes, now.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Oh, yeah?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
Excuse me�
Wait a minute. How do you feel this morning?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Thank you!
Shall we let the people come in?
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Hello, darling.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
No.
Good morning.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why well, I�
Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Longer.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Dickson they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Helen!
Yes?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Yes, sir.
Well, well, well got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
I already told him I was home.
There you are.
Of course it's true and he knows it.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
The lobby's half filled now.
What are you talking about?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Don't you think I know it?
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Oh, is that so?
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Matt.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Yeah, swell.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Yeah.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office?
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
All right, dear.
Oh, Matt . . .
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
There you are!
Listen here, young man nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it�
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
Then who changed it?
I don't know.
So you were home last night?
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about uh eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Yes.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
Okay, Matt.
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Everybody in?
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
You can ride like that?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
I couldn't lose him.
Jim Younger, I told you
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
He's smiling.
Never a good thing.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
That was two hours ago.
Here's Liberty's favorite son! I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does.
You stay out of this, Bob.
We got a problem here, brother?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
This is the best score yet.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Leave me alone, Bob.
How'd they
What have you done?
I ain't done
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I'm sorry, Cole.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
He's not bad at it.
It's tougher than it looks.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Yesterday.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Then I love it.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
... Will Perry ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
How many of them did he kill?
Two.
You have no shame.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Exactly.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Beg pardon?
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Tell me.
What?
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?
I could use the walk.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road. Let's ride, Rangers!
Where you boys going?
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She got two of them.
She had a moustache.
She was European!
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
The JamesYounger Gang.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
I got seven thousand.
I got three.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Twenty?!
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What will be?
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Still smells fishy.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Dammit!
A trap.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Pass me some whisky.
We'll make them pay for this.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you, cousin.
Missed you too, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Where'd you get all these riders?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
What the
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Sadie was not a man!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare. He's European.
Ah.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Get buckets!
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
The safe. Now.
Of course! Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
All right, all right. Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Me get heap firewater
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
You're right, sir.
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What the
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered. From back there.
Shit.
Web died fighting?
Died a hero.
Boys...
Go home, Doc. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you say, sir?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
They're gone. What are you
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
So we got a plan?
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
That just might work.
Maybe, maybe...
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
She's still talking to Jesus.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
You know him?
Heard of him.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody
Shut up. Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Bob's upset.
The posters?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
We're drunk.
Oh yeah.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
No, I
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Got any ideas, little brother?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Uncle Frank?
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Easterners.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Ma! Please!
Boys?
Riders
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Doc Mimms will
Shush.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
But still died.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Jesse, are you awake?
Mmmm.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Nuhhuh ...
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Let the law
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop?
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Zee.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
I don't understand.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
Don't turn around.
What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Yes ma'am.
Tennessee?
I'll explain on the way.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Pity.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
No, I'll hang you. But I may miss you just a bit.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
Communion.
And you're too young.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And the same age Web was. No.
I like that.
No.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
... too young for whisky...
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really?
Don't talk about it much, though.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
I'm doing you folks a favor
There's only four of them...
Move you fools!
Your men knew the risks.
What is going on here, man?
With my money!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
I look forward to seeing it.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
That.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
This is him.
I remember you.
How did you know?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
So he's won.
No.
What the hell is that sound?
Vengeance.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
It's a plain end. I think.
Turn the light on.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, butyou know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special? Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
Patrick?
Yes?
Nothing.
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to. But I can make an exception.
Do you take American Express?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
I don't think so.
Nothing like last time, promise.
Alright.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Oh, lawyers are so complicateddon't do that. Here.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
It's not that nice.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's goodlooking.
Everybody's goodlooking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
I want a firm commitment.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you think?
Nice.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
I know her. I knew her.
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Listen, what about dinner?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Are you my two o'clock?
No.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back.
I won't...don't worry.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Face itthe Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Call me please, Patrick.
Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's Paul Owen.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh my God...
What?
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking AllBran.
SHUT UP!
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I guess you're right... THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
What's that, a gram?
New card. What do you think?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Ask me a question.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
This.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Dorsia, yes?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
See you then.
Late?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You look nice today.
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
What is it?
Patrick?
Yees, Jean?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only tenthirty.
Patrick?
Can you bring Mr...
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Dorsia is...fine.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Jean? Sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
Jean? What?
Make someone happyhave you ever wanted to?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Welt...it depends, why?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Hello
She's my...cousin.
Uh huh?
She's from...France.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twentysix. I'll be twentyseven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Fiftyfive West EightyFirst Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
Bad habit.
I know. I'm sorry.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Well...
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
Yeah...Yale thing.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
Not really.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Justthey'reHuey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. Solunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
I'll be there.
No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean it'shave you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Suit yourself, I guess.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and � you.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I'm so hungry.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
I've been great. And you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting. Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Another Martini, Paul?
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Is it over?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
'Gonna wait outside.
Alice? You gotta make him do the startup with Teddy and me.
"Make" him?
You know what I mean.
I'm just screwed.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can paint anywhere.
It's important.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That took some fun out of
We're not gonna let it.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
