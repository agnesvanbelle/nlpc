Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad. Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be
There.
Where?
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring samesex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
No
Okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Combination. I don't know I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include dooropening and coatholding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th. For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
You did what?
Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastrointestinal display
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruitloop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick is that a.
Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, I
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night
The prom? Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So which Dakota you from?
North, actually. How'd you ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirtytwo.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl I
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shiteating grin?
Joey Dorsey? Permashitgrin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly Alist. With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
Hey I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice? Besides when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one. She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at fortyone.
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.
It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way.
Yeah we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indierock persuasion".
So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?
You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey do you mind?
Not at all
Where ya goin?
Away.
Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.
And why would I do that?
Yeah
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Hey it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Just a little.
What's this?
An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his maledominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work?
No fear.
What'd he say?
Who cares?
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?
Who?
William he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey tell me we haven't' progressed to fullon hallucinations.
I mean Woman. How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then
Oh, right. Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Like where? The 7Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You covered in my vomit.
Seventhirty?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Okay?
I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!
What?
And I'm in control of it.
But it's Gigglepuss I know you like them. I saw you there.
When you were gone last year where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
I should do this.
Do what?
This.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so
Pleasant?
Wholesome.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
C'mon. It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
You up for it?
For. . . ?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No something real. Something no one else knows.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly selfassured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had. You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
My grandmother's .
What?
That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone my grandfather died I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out! By the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a setup!
It wasn't like that.
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're fortyfive and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want
Was that your sister?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
Just smack her now.
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Yeah. I guess.
You think?
Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
Say it
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
We're your guys.
What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a "nonsmoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?
No I've got a sweetpayin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you're such a fuckup?
Well, you know there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.
See you next week!
In the microwave.
Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!
But who what ?
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
He's the devil's child...
We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered blackskinned people. I, too, will find other populations and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
IFGODWILLSIT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.
Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...
Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
What is it, now? Tell me...
I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...
No?
NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...? Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.
What do you see?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
Say not here! Cuba!
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Island. Far.
You come! You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort.
Chief says how many?
Thousands.
Why?
To bring the word of God.
Chief says he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
Colon!
Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh? So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right. Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vicepresident and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your exwife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twentyfive hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred.
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's soninlaw and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
He's on to us!
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gutshoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Wonderful!
I'm okay.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact.
Got you for 450, 500 bucks?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Not here.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. Er
Evan. He's a muckymuck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a fullblown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Shit.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Piece of fucking cake.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
There's your old twentygauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
He sure as hell won't.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I'm sorry for the screwup. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trickortreating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trickor treating. They're still out.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
You can't.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His soninlaw damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's fatherinlaw shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!
Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand
From Boston. Evan Twombley's sonin law he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grownup person.
It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing just now?
I'm her father supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.
Wade.
What happened?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.
Can ?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
Take care, Wade.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right.
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Marg!
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Marg! You got orders!
You talked to Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Kerbang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting. I gotta go.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Rolfe.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!
Just do it.
Attago.
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
You nogood pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
Where's Ma?
She's coming.
Yeah.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You! By Christ, you I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nahnahnaw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck stolen!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his soninlaw who's vicepresident and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his soninlaw is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own fatherinlaw, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset one thing on top of another.
Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
For what?
To help, Jack, of course and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I said something.
I know you did!
No, not her. Me.
Who's you?
My name is AL.
Al ???!!!
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
What's going on?
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Don't do that.
Why not.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
You're in my head...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
I see...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Shut up!
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Quit screwing around, this is important.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
You've heard of the PEM114...
That a new Datsun?
Are you threatening me?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Me? What'd I do?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
I know...it sounds insane.
You said it.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Don't do it. Don't aim at the head.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
You'll be alive.
With a man in my head...
Yeah.
What was that?
Who was that? Somebody out there?
You weren't listening!
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why don't you?
No they won't.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Anyone there?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Behind us?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
What's that?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
What'd he look like?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
What do I do?
Outrun them.
This is a Fiesta!
Now what?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
I wouldn't say that.
Then what are you stopping for?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Calm Down! Act rational.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I don't know...To get Al.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Did you hear that?
Yeah. Al wants to talk to you!
It can't take that long.
Why?
JOE Or what?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
They could put you back in the tube..
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head. ...We'll have to do it on our own.
What do you mean we.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Find You?
I'm not gonna make it easy.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Sue them.
I'll sue.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
Where are we going?
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
The man.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
I can't remember..
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Gone where?
Don't know.
You need ID in there?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Nothing!
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
Who is it?
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
What is it?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What do we do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You are not alone. But you are incon picuous...and, with our abilities...
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about money?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
...and a license to kill...
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
They'll know who I am.
We'll change your appearance.
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You leave my glands alone!
Now what?
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?
Just get there.
Holy shit!
What is it?
...Just beautiful.
Do you notice anything.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Swim.
Good Idea!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Little late for that.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Now what?
The sand.
Eat it?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Where are you going? Wait!
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Beautiful!
What was?
A girl.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Follow it.
She's...pretty fast.
You're out of shape.
What is it?
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
Help me out, will you?
What can I do? You're on your own.
What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
.
Wait.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Where are you staying?
Touch her.
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
...Joe.
No...you idiot!
What happened?
...Rene...
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
It worked.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Well you did it today.
Yeah. I did it.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Now, where would I be?
What are you looking at?
But what's it look like?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Is something glinting?
What is it?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
You really like that shirt?
This...is not going to work out.
Much too blue.
Not blue enough.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Not that tie with that coat.
Why not?!
What did that cost?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Doesn't.
Which one is she?
The beautiful one.
They both look good to me.
You have no taste.
Get close to them.
That place. By the window.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Who, me?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
That's a big if.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
What glasses.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Follow that busboy.
Are you serious?
I feel like an idiot.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Killer!
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
He recognises you, throw him off.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Don't get too cute.
Joe, be careful!
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
It's embarrassing.
What if she says something important?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
What am I supposed to do?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
What Happened?
I don't know!
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Is that all?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
She's got the most beautiful...s
Shit! You're in love.
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You get time off to sleep.
No. What do you hope? AL I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
No. What will you do.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
You been had. We have.
It wasn't like that.
Some agent you are.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of HighTech.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
Come on, she's getting away.
I can't keep up.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
That's not funny.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Don't touch a thing.
Don't worry!
...drink it.
Too late.
What next!
Drink lots of water.
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
What are you doing?
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take and .
Ow!
A hard left. A hard left.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
Neither can they.
He was with Gruner!
You were with GRUNER!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
No. You can't trust her.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
Probably.
I don't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
It's him.
Come on.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
You sure this will work?
Not sure at all.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
What was it? What'd I say?
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Cash.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Well...?
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
Where?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Do it.
I can't handle that thing.
Don't worry, I can.
Are you alright?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim just in front of his face.
Aim what?
Holy...
...Shit! It's just money.
He aready made the deal..
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Dieter!
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
There's a lot you don't know.
And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverseengineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Do something.
What exactly?
I don't know.
What happened?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Gimme a minute.
Looks like you can have all you want.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Rene?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
She is beautiful.
You've changed your mind.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Oh no!
I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
They can?
You're a lucky man.
Yeah, sure.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
You're lovely.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Awwww...
I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
That's nice.
What are you doing?
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
GOTOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.
JOE What abilities...?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
You just got a Mickey.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Not that truth!
Aren't we all.
Sorry...
It'll remind me of you.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
The best part. She'll love it.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
Do what? What'd you do?
What is your name?
Don't give her your name.
No!
Oh, I can't.
Good.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Dieter?
I'm against it.
I insist.
Can you fly this?
Don't worry.
I'm...scared.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
I didn't do anything.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Nice?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
I knew you were trouble.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
They have stolen state property.
What a nerve!
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Rene?
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
Impossible.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Who's our little man?
Me.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control reenlargement, from inside.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Then how did you know?
You've cut your hair?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
PEM115!
**?!!
Newer, more powerful design.
How about a deal?
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
We'll have to let them go.
Surveilliance on them all.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
He work for us?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
What Job?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Who is your friend?
We met on the beach.
Join us.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
It's just money.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
I don't want to intrude.
We insist.
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
...Foreign service.
And how do you service foreigners.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
What brings you here?
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
I think I've heard of you.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
I will?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
I don't know Who.
Al?
The little man in my... ...head...
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Sue who?
You...him...UST.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
I noticed you staring.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
A little voice in my head.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Sir?
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Now you know what I know.
Sir?
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
The fresh tuna?..
Yessir...very good sir.
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said something first.
Oh...and who is it!?
I didn't say anything.
What do you do about what?
...I'm looking for someone.
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
...Blake
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Yes?
Blake said that?
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
And you.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
What's so funny?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way?
What way?
Like there's someone else here.
Wait. What's your name?
...Rene.
You mean from it.
Yes, of course.
And you?
I just work for the travel firm.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
...I...don't know.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Are you alright?
Promise you what?
That you're not crazy.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
Just Okay...
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
That depends...
Joe! What happened to you?
Why'd you run off?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
You did.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
You know where he went?
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
Got to trust someone.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
You think I'm like that?
What's Gruner like?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And you?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Where we going?
Beats me.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pickup, a rendezvous.
Then where's the chip.
What?
He plays it all the time.
Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Get us one.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Where what?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
What?
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I asked him.
Oh.
Why'd you ask him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
What?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've been there?
I know the territory.
You coming along?
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Why not?
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Why?
What a mess.
You can say that again. What do we do?
Nothing we can do.
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Can't you do something?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
It was my choice.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Why did you, then?
For you.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
How?
What?
Now what?
I've never met anyone like you.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
I love you too.
Don't worry.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Escape.
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
You're gonna laugh.
Kiss her you fool.
Her?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
We just don't stop.
He can't help us.
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
But you did it. It was you.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
If he was able, what would he say.
Come on.
That's twenty feet high.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
Riuji?
I told you, I work for him.
What is it?
We're not moving fast enough for him.
He wants to apologise.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
What could you find in this place?
...Piece of mind.
Excuse me?
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Why are you on to him?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What about the others.
I don't know.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Is there anything else?
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Thanks.
Wait.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It's alright.
It is?
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Mom...what are you doing here?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Right there.
Thank you.
This the only spare?
Yes.
The other working.
Perfectly.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Poor bastard.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Too much.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Whoever took it does.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
What about Al...
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
For reading.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Okay.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in." ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
Where?
In the backyard.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A. Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have exagent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their exsupervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Lowell?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
Three hours.
You got a deal.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Catch you later.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier... Push the deadline, Charlie...
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Okay.
What does that do?
What do you mean, what's it do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Alright, alright.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
I can't get out of here til mid morning. I'll be in tomorrow night... Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on... Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Good.
The subheading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistleblower."
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
How about you?
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world. "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Lunch?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibilliondollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're exaggerating!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, mostexpensive corporatemalfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
So, what are you going to do?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
End up in a highprofile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so. Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anticapitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm not touching my film...
I'm afraid you are.
No, I'm not...
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again. As they start to leave...
Before you go...
And what are you implying?
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests... "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger... Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
That computer has everything...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a followup.
Okay.
Catch ya' later.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
Are you sure?
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
How grave?
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
"Mike?"
What does that mean? "Rife with ?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Come again?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Hi, baby.
Catch you later.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Call me back in ten.
Hello?
Jim, it's Lowell.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Okay. Lowell?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistleblower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No. I'm assuming the cavein begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Try the car.
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything?
No, thank you.
What's going on?
I told him that you had an Email death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
...taping? What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
That's for food.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Yes... Jeffrey.
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Yes.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
No classes this morning?
Will he go oncamera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Hello? Yeah...
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Two p.m. Great. Byebye.
..."ignition propensity?" ...you understand any of this...?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M." It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I have to take a shower.
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey Wigand...
Jeffrey...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's halfmeasures.
You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
Is it too late?
No. No, it's okay... How's how's the new place?
Oh, my God.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.
Area code 2125550199.
I'll call you then.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistleblowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, I'm here.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
All right. See you...
We're there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Don't interpret that! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!! Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
You eating with us?
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Hardly new news.
No shit.
What's this?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
So, is everything okay?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Thank you for saying that...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
Oh, man.
Who are these people?
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Good.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else?
I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
What?
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell!
What?
I'm with Don on this.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio. That decision I've already made.
Yeah.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
I think it was a disgrace.
Did I get you up?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, lots.
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Mike... in my...
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Everything interests me.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with proZionist American media?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face. That's why.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
No. We don't do that. You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highestrated, mostrespected, TVmagazine news show in America.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
That's good. That works. Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Who's that?
That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Black, black...
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Like what? Your sign?
I know what I have to know.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
...but that's as far as I go...
Far as you go where?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?
Did work.
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Should I just take the documents now?
If you want to do it.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Fuck you, too!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Good. I want to talk to you.
What do...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage. ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
They should be.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All healthrelated. What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi finals?
Seven dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on CSPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco. You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else. What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
The new place? New.
You okay?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house?
Good. You have kids?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
...okay.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's okay.
What did you get us?
Tempura...
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Next to your father?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was fiveyears old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Why?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake... I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around! I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
You believe that?
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Yes.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I don't think you really understand
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
Excuse me. Yeah...
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
They do this with impunity!
Jeff...
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
Good. But Jeff...
I'll call them, Lowell.
Liane, this is a preliminary... You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really I didn't know how to do that...
Lowell, I can't afford
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Did you have a good day?
You attract a crowd.
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
I don't know what to do.
What's changed?
You mean... since this morning?
No. I mean since whenever...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that oncamera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the Bside...
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
What?!
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block... But you, I mean, I know how...
No.
No? No, what?
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes... ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
I told the truth!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
She sued you for back payments of child support?
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint... Any other questions?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
What?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk. You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes? Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's not the point.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs. I am trying to protect you, man!
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You fought for me...?! ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'? You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
No, no. Don't call the police! Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
Did he hear you?
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What about now?
What?
Hello, can you hear me now?
What's happening?!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I can't say that!
No, you can. Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Just give me an example...
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people. Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How's Liane?
She's okay.
Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Well, what do you really think, though?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all. You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So, what were you calling about?
You called me.
What are you talking about?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
There is there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Liane has filed for divorce...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Mike's our Attorney General down here. I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out... However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lungspecific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Poor communication skills.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
"I would bet on it."
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you... ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk! Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not! Answer the question, Dr...
Hello.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
My cocounsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smokingrelated illness. If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
When should we do this?
Jail?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co pay, that's like... Tuition...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead. Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Chapter and verse.
Yeah, I know you do... You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep. I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff. About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
"Research..." You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
That's why we hire scientists...
Okay. I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you beat you
Well, I wouldn't say
Your husband, who has beaten you repeatedly
He
Please was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
They hate each other
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Miles, how nice of you to see us may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my exbrother in law. Martin Reiser?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what twelve?
Here. Got pictures.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it
we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Baby. You are so HOT!
Howard!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard I wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement.
And there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey prenup has never been penetrated.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey this is one bad bad little girl.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
After you, Doll.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
So she's uh, flourishing?
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Muh Well, uh Huh?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for what you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Well Marylin and Rex broke up and...
No!
I had no idea until after, but
What a touching story.
You know, Miles, after my wife wife's mastectomy things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but... I like my women with two boobs.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I just want to make sure that you both
understand what you're asking for here. The Massey prenup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The prenup protects the wealthier party.
Well at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
and we are sure...
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Who do you want me to kill?
Well I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart uh, Massey.
Is that... one person?
Here's her picture...
You're in a rush.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Mr. Dumbarton.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
No...
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
I'm sorry. That was unkind and but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
Sustained.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Why in God's name would I want...?
No frown lines. New watch?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
You're in check.
I should be in therapy.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a prenup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil? A Massey Prenup? She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
I have it.
You have the prenup?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a prenup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the prenup.
Oh. I thought maybe Gee!
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
It's your move, Miles.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
My God.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
What do you mean, was.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Yes.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no prenup.
So, that's good, right?
Who was that?
That was oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Huh?
Marylin! What have I done?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirtysix years, ever since you were married
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For TransWorld Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
He manufactures staples and industrial bradtacks. He's very successful.
So who'd you hire?
Ruth Rabino.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin solidify your position.
No.
You like kids.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Why do you think she did it?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
I begged you to have a baby!
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
You're vulnerable.
It's about time.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
I said yes.
Is Tong older than Ming?
I think Ming is older than Tong. What is this?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know
It sounded like a bell.
I'll be right back.
Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
How nice.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
These are yours.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
I assume this is on Rex?
Isn't everything?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
What does your lawyer think?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
I know you do.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
He wants a reconciliation.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Gotcha.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount.
Well, don't look at mine!
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you've always loved him?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
He'll regret this.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Oh, for the love of...
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your prenup is the best there is?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
we are both sure that's what we want?
Absolutely.
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Marylin! Listen to me.
No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
But why him?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
The Massey prenup has never been pene successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
No, that's not all.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Well, when this goes south promise you'll have dinner with me?
Have you tried the duck?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Although knowing you as I do there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
To victory.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You sound like my mother.
Hello?
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? When did I say...?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Screw you, asswipe!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you drunk?
A little. You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin come here right now before just come here.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for
No. Don't stop.
Okay Miles.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre Castro Cubans.
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
We're damaged goods.
No, we're not!
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Friends?
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I have to say I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such volume.
And I'm not used to Marylin there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
I want... I want to...
I want to be your your wife.
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Yes. Again.
I don't have a ring!
I know.
I have a watch.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
No. Judge just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Oh Miles!
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
But?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house it's a bachelor pad.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms a billiard room, a card room, a gym Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie
Good. Are those foods?
Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then maybe not right away There's a room right off the bedroom It would be perfect for a nursery. It's a walk in humidor right now but if I took out the refrigeration unit
Miles.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so
Hi.
Hello Marylin.
I have a surprise for you.
I bet.
You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles? You're scaring me.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
May I come in?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have "things."
On the contrary. We're married and we have no prenup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Comfy!
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about
STUFF. Got a light?
What kind of "stuff?"
Arty Farty stuff. Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Those are gifts.
Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH. What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague. I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's blackmail.
That's marriage.
Hello?
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles
No buts. Now. Out.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Please! Leave the house.
I fell in love Miles.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and
You do? You do love me?
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Nonono. Marylin I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
That's true.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hello Marylin.
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
It's not something I wanted either.
But then I guess something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
PreCastro.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship. What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Sweet.
I thought so.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have everything we have is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Dogs?
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is off.
Do you need a Tagamet?
You have some?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Sometimes I forget.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I was devastated. Of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Who's that?
Jesus.
Is this a lover?
Please!
Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.
He told me to he said he wanted me to
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
He never even asked. He just assumed
He was right, wasn't he?
So. Now what?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it quite a paper trail he had it in the dog's name.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
She did a Harriman.
Wow.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Miles Massey.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Who's she?
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Maybe.
We do have a man for you.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I wish I had your discipline.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
He has a reputation for being tough.
Lilly's up.
Oh, God!
Every week
I'm dying.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
So where are you now?
Well, if he continues to maintain this position we're in court.
Shit.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
You're not...
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona this is Miles Massey.
Hello Miles.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I want to be exposed.
Is this Ming?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Right.
What?
He's not what I expected. He's very he's so happy.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Well, that's about to change big time.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
I guess.
is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Wait. I know you.
Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Excuse me?
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake prenup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you. Neener neener neener.
Herb wants to see me?
When you have a moment.
Mr. Massey
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she
She's here now.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
What?!
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
That's delusional.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
Heh heh.
So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
...arty farty!
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
He divorced his wife he married Marylin he divorced Marylin and he remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He never ate the prenup, did he!
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey prenup.
I don't have a prenup
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
That's attorney client privilege. Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose
Where does that leave us?
We've outlined a settlement...
Mr. Rexroth.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
Now Rex.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
When I first met Marylin Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mm.
But then... But then...
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knockout. And very sexy but there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before
Well, with the expanding global population Let me ask you this your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knockout, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking is there a prenup?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Nothing?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some minimalls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined I'll lose millions.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Well is that possible?
What's Kirshner?
Please let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner what's your bottom line?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Wrigley!
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I it gets me every time. It's so optimistic.
Is she going through with it?
What do you think?
What are they?
Berry spoons.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever
Miles why so angry?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
HA!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Wrigley?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Do you have it?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the the...
the coin?
Extinguish?
Should we counsel fear or trust? Should we seek to destroy or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism or with love?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know you are her...?
Mother?
Hi, Sweetie.
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
You were never invited to meet your soninlaw?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman? She always said "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
Who's Rex's guy?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Muriel Rumsey.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Maybe next time.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
And only two are hers.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
It's not enough! Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
No. He's been trailed twentyfour hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
Oh�Mary�
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Why�uh�she's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than�
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir�she sent me for a drink. Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Can't you get them to go any faster? This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
"I found a million dollar baby�"
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me�those things give me a stiff pain.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if�
No�no. What the deuce do I want to�
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
Come in. Sit down.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami� for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in�
If I didn't I wouldn't be here! I've got it all itemized.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you want�thirty nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I know�but�
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Let me get this straight. You want this thirtynine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
What ten thousand?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for�
All I want is thirtynine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to�
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Yeah�with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
That's an evasion.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day�whether it's coming to her or not.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself�long ago.
Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
What's this about not eating?
I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want! But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You ought to know why. Because�
Yes. I know. Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because�
Because marrying that fool King Westley is�
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not. Yes?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
You can't tempt me. Do you hear? I won't eat!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Where are you taking me?
South America.
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it�if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were. Mmm�mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
What've you got against King Westley?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigolo�or something.
Never mind�I'll get it myself. Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men�particularly if you're a shining example.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. I'm sick of it!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Ellie�
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been daydreaming.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Nothing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm�I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions�I� Isn't all this what you wanted? You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Oh, no.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare�I�when I couldn't find you. You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious. Where'd you meet him?
On the road.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No.
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him. Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all that�we'll move heaven and earth to�
It'll do no good. He despises me.
Oh, come now�
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Ridiculous!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Fine man to fall in love with.
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I don't know.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
No, I'll go through with it.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why�
It doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you�made your life so miserable�and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Yes, I guess I have. I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous. Besides, what difference does it make? I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Yes. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne!
Why? Do you know him?
Oh, no�no.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, Dad�
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
I'll be going. Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I�
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Why should she? After all�
All right. That's why I sent for you. There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement�that you've had a talk with me�that we've reached an understanding�that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
If you really mean it, I will.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to� �as long as I can get her back.
On a hunger strike, huh? When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday�or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
It's not quite that simple. I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one�
Absurd! All this fuss over a snip of a girl. I'm going down to see her myself.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Lower the boats!
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls. They're terrible!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants. She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on�she can raise some money on that?
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that. Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads�all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made that quite evident�with all your threats of annulment. Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh? All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me. Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Why; naturally, I�
Naturally. You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You talk as if�
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
No? Say, listen�I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers�some of the most powerful people in the world�but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy. Now listen�if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What would you like to have me do?
Sock her!
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me�and maybe we'll be friends� Maybe. Do we understand each other?
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that�
Personally, I think it's stupid! But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space. Goodbye.
We've done that already.
Yes, of course.
What happened?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston. "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Any others?
Yessir. There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
What do they say?
They're practically all the same, sir.
Amateurs!
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
Don't want to talk to�don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh. Hello my wouldbe exsoninlaw. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap. Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling." Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
But the lady says�
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much. We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York�and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Me? Forget it, son. I got millions.
Thanks.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn� As life's corners I . . .
All right, let it go.
. . . turn."
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
No.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Whadda you want!
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
What do you think you're doing!
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh�the papers�
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do�kid me?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Oh, yeah?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh, yeah?
You win!
Driver!
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Maybe they do�and maybe they don't.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Phone for help? We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
I beg your pardon!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you� scram.
Driver!
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Are you talking to me?
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Well�of all the�well� Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
That cadaverouslooking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
What am I going to do now?
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, no�I� Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I don't want it reported!
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that�
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported! Please stay out of my affairs! I want to be left alone. A CLOSEUP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Oh, thank you. We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
No, thank you. Thank you so much.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that. What time is the next bus to New York?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Don't tell me you did it on my account! hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is� You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
What are you talking about?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You must have me confused with�
Quit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
Take my advice�grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Here, boy!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Of course I do. What do you mean�
Beat it!
You have your nerve! Here, boy�!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
That's none of your business.
You're on a budget from now on.
Now, just a minute�you can't�
Shut up!
Hey, Brat�! The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Come on�we're stopping here for the night.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do�leap for joy?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is colossal.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you? All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A dayto day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This? Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but� you've been very kind.
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy? Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
That, I suppose, makes everything�uh�quite all right.
Oh, this?�I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me. Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet. Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses. Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first�then the tie�then the shirt�now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different. go for the shoes first. After that I�
Smart aleck!
Do you mind putting out the light?
Not at all.
Who are you?
Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
The pleasure is all mine.
Here�
What is it? Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. You�you had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
Listen, Brat�I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
You'll find the showers�and things�right back of the second cottage.
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Here�take mine.
Where'd you say the showers�and things�were?
Hey�you're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I'll find it myself.
High time you got back.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
If you didn't waste so much time on that wisecracking drummer�we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime. Come on, sit down.
Thank you. My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
I thought maybe�uh�"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night. Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks. You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um. You're doing all right.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even bodyguards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I�I did it once; actually went shopping without a bodyguard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
King�King Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Umhm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Detectives!
That's Father at work, What'll I do? Peter, what'll I do?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at WilkesBarre she'll never forgive us.
What are you talking about?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You don't have to lose your temper! That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you�
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Well, you were!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a twoperson stock company. If things get tough�we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Next week "East Lynne."
After that "The Three Musketeers." I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderella�or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I refuse to resign!
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
I better go over and see her.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman�a trip like this.
Yes.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately. Ouch!
What's the matter?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls. Why did we have to leave the bus?
I don't trust that chatterbox.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you mean�starvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Why, haven't you�?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I didn't give him anything . You were the bighearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women. How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
Okay. Hang on to these.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Sorry. It's the first time I've ridden "piggyback" in years.
This isn't "piggyback."
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggyback" ride�
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggyback" riding.
My uncle�Mother's brother�had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggyback."
I don't think there's a "piggy back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggyback" rider.
That's silly.
To be a "piggybacker" it takes complete relaxation�a warm heart�and a loving nature.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
Show me a good "piggyback" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance�a natural "piggybacker." Where do you get off with your stuffedshirt family? Why, your father knew so much about "piggyback" riding that he�
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Peter�
What?
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What!
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter�
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
know�but�
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
was�but�
But what!
was so scared�that it scared�
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Sure.
What?
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Try me.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitchhiking.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking�
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife.
Hay�in my teeth.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in. What're you eating?
Carrots.
Raw?
Uhhuh. Want one?
No!! It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. Best thing in the world for you�carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me�goodnight!
I hate the horrid stuff.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "HitchHikers Hail."
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it�
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement� That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Clever.
Number two is a wider movement�a smile goes with that one�like this. That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke�and hungry�and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this� �with a follow through.
Amazing.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Here comes a car!
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had. Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car�and I won't use my thumb.
What're you going to do?
Mind your own business.
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
We don't need forty cars.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
Never! I'm going in and ask him�
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Come on�get in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on�
Come on! come on!
What happened?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
What'd you give him for the car?
A black eye.
You don't have to eat the carrots. Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Darling!
Any luck?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Okay. Cottage Number Three.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yeah, swell.
Thank you. Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Why not?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Maybe. Sure�sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd� Yeah, but where you going to find her�somebody that's real�somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself. Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. Oh, Peter�
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur. Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited�
Hey, wait a minute! Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
ONE�TWO�THREE�FOUR�FIVE
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
�six�seven�eight�nine�
I'm out! I'm out!
Maybe I could jump out of the window. Do you think they'd see me?
Come here, you little fool!
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Who�me? Want to see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and�and scared.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Well, I am.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . . People like you spend all your life on a merrygoround. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy. You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away. From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Do you know?
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a stranglehold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish. If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed� Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired�and it's the only thing around.
You sound like a hobo.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested.
Won't I ever see you again?
How are you, Ellie? Are you happy?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. Here you are, King. Let's drink. Let's drink to us . We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merrygoround and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Whatever you say, darling.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it�the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo. Come on, King. You're lagging.
Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus�I told them to wait!
Sorry, Miss. It's gone. Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Sorry, Miss.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
What's the matter? Where's your husband, young lady�
Husband?
Yes�if he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, he'll be back.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything. Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the�
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
But can't you wait until morning�
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
You made no mistake sitting next to me. Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a goodlookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff�much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Funontheside Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real loveydovey. Yessir.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Sorry�I didn't mean to�
Get out!
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, by the way�what's your name?
What's that?
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Hey�you not up yet? Come on�come on!
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
I'm hungry.
Just your imagination.
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
I said, the old man's screwy!
Yeah!
The dame's too smart for him.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
What's up?
Bridge washed out�around Dawson.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep�there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Yeah? Where?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Thanks.
Mr. Gordon�
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
What! Say, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay far away from this office�unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Throw it in the basket. What's it say? "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Collect?
Yes.
Don't accept any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants. Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh? What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve. Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that�
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, Gordon�I�
Get out!
Joe, listen�
Don't "Joe" me.
Okay, Joe. Listen�you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn�anytime I ran into a story that looked good�I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
A thousand dollars! Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars�and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
What's the thousand bucks for?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
What!
Never mind . . . Listen�suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Huh?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah.
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
For heaven's sake, Joe�stop being an editor for just a minute. We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. I'm in love with her, Joe.
Well, I'll be�
Listen, Pal�you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Okay, pete.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful! Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn! Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn�then something comes along�messes up the finish�and there you are.
Yeah, where am I?
When you sober up�come in and see me.
Thanks, Joe.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twentyfive dollars.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Listen, man�I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
ain't got a hat�
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Well, you got one now. �Come on, fill 'er up.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah?
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
A trumpet?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
I dunno.
You send telegrams here?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you? To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is�" No, do you really?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of�of�"
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Send it collect.
Collect?
Collect.
There you go�trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you�
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Mebbe.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
I don't trust him.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Who?
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
See that. They're gone!
Looks like it, don't it? Here's the woman, ma.
Oh!!
Then�you'll have to git !
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Not a minute!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Zeke. Git!
Yes, Ma.
Well, you're two up on me now.
Hey, you!
Huh?
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with my�uh�wife�if you don't mind.
Wife?
Yeah. Come on�come on!
Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'�you know�to make things pleasant.
What's up?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Say, Buddy�
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Thanks.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Yeah�wouldn't it?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What?
I'd go fiftyfifty with you .
Why?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Five G's�or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby. We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to�
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Huh?
A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?
Why�no�
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Yeah�the "big boy"�the Boss of the outfit.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that pennyante reward, do you? Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see�and�
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with�
Shshsh�! Soft pedal, you mug!�before I� What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! Now listen, you're in this thing�and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ?�How do I know? I gotta good mind to plug you. I shouldn't take any chances on you.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Where do you live?
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Mister�you wouldn't�you ain't thinkin' about�
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Sure�sure�I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
If you don't�Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Gee! That musta been terrible. I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kindhearted.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Sure. Anything you say.
Boss, Oswald impersonators? Sounds like James Bond now.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close. Goddamn, Sam! If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist. They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match. I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door. If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks. If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business. Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Not one word. That's an order.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA. We got the same problem with the governors. All of them. Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this. It went all over the country. Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report! Read it, Al.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 2223. Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Gentlemen, I will not hear this. I value Bill as much as anyone here. We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man? We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go. Grain of salt. Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two. Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight. How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing. I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza. Truth is, I never met the dude.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano. You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim only not as good as it used to. Good chowder, ain't it?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Street cats?
Swishes. They swish, y'know. Young fags, you know. They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up? These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always like tits on a pig. I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Recall any names?
Mario, Jose they wear names like you and I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Hell, no! I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here. The Feebees run background checks. On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got. There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim. If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake. How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know. It was Oswald. He was a nut job. Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch! They're grieving like they knew the man. It makes me want to puke.
God's sake, chief. The President was shot.
A bullshit President! I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote. They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Bullshit! Bartender, another round... Here's to the New Frontier. Camelot in smithereens. I'll drink to that.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.
Get home my ass. We're going to the office, have another drink. I want some company tonight.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination? Just goes to show, you can never know about some people. Am I right, Jack? Well, bless my soul. Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack. Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here. Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on. You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files? I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange people.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. Three years later and he's still classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald. Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17. He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate. He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick. He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan. Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia. That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it. As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed. I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that. It gets weirder.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember. Stick to what you can prove in court.
You want facts, Bill? Okay. From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia. From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald. All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Who?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
No!... Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This is incredible.
Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie. You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people! We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here! What the hell do we really got? Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead. Shaw maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Bill.
Hey, where y'at, Frank? You're wasting your time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill. Real serious. We know what's been going on at your office
Yeah, I guess you do.
You've got nothin', Bill. I'm talking as a friend now. You're riding on the Titanic. Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Who do you think fed him that information? Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life. You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
No, I'm not...
Yes, you are. Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger. Castro did. But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy millions of people are gonna die. That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison. Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you! You're too goddamn self opinionated, now shut up. If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me. Listen real hard.
Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought we were on the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Pretty fast, wasn't it. The way they let him go.
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill. I leave the theories to you lawyers.
You, Numa?
It's addressed to no one and no signature. "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect. I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
With whose testimony? Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute. Jack Martini? A drunk? Vernon Bundy? A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association they're not...
Yeah. They were seen together in Clinton in early September. The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs. I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain. But it's tough, boss no one wants to talk about Shaw. He's...
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
Clay Bertrand? Sure I know him. He comes around the Quarter.
Who is he, Joe? I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk. You too, Bill, even if you're family. He's a big shot businessman. I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots. A fag, you know. Goes by another name down here.
What's the other name?
Shaw. Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Did he pay you for this?
Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it's no secret. That's what I'm here for.
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess. Dave's mind was a mess, Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart real smart speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics. He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him as...
Fuck, yes. Hell, I'm already in jail. I got no reason to lie to you. I ain't no nigger.
Go on, Willie.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Hold your horses. What kinda source?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning? It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again. Now here's another one for you: What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious. And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago. How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand. If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias. Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve. We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too. I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Gee, thanks boss.
I'm lost, boss. What are we saying here?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. That's what you're saying!
I'll go you one better! Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing. It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue. There's no chain of evidence, Bill. And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository? One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill "a patsy". Take it at face value. Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here. He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right? What's in a name, right? In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake. A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code several different people can use the same name, right? Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
But why?
To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss. Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Let's start making some assumptions about the man. Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. Who found the evidence? Who set him up? Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 see if it's the same guy.
Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough. Nobody's talking.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters. They're sitting home reading all these lies. I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" not on the Kennedy killing, but on us. One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Those bastards! That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature. "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible. I offered you love. All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
All right, all right. Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
I don't buy it, chief why would the FBI cover it up? You're talking the whole FBI here. A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
There's a word orders.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill. I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care. I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose! We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government. Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up. Hoffa Trafficante Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro. Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q. Citizen. So they close the book on J.F.K. It makes sense to me.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level. Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back? Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation? Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up? Could the Mob wreck the autopsy? Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules. This was a militarystyle ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved? The President of the United States?
I know this, Bill Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices? Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered? Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
With a fullblown conspiracy to cover it up? Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Yeah.
Julius Caesar: "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men." Who killed Caesar? Twenty, twentyfive Senators. All it takes is one Judas, Bill a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
This is Louisiana, chief. How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one. Jim sighs, saddened. Bill was one of his best men.
What's it look like, Nick?
I don't see any violence, Jim. Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know. Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
...Oswald?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
You know damn well who it is.
Dave?
Yeah, you got it. Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds? The whole building's been a zoo since that broke. We can't get a thing done. Reporters crawling everywhere. You think we want that?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects. I can't go home. I'm out on the street. The maggots are everywhere! Do you know what you've done to me? It's all over the national news now. You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man! From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret? You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, just calm down. Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes. I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
The Fontainbleau? 20 minutes?
Yeah. Come on, Dave, come on our side. I guarantee you the boss'll protect you... Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah! He'd kill for you Dave. He likes you. Your mind.
I got no place to sleep. I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
I'm caught in the middle. They're after me. It's almost over.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Dave, I always play square. No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry. Whenever you're ready.
I don't have much time. They don't even need bugs anymore. They got these fuckin' satellite waves. They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes. He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment. A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother. You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does. I'm so fuckin' tired. Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot! He's got me by the balls.
What do you mean?
Photographs compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em. The Agency plays for keeps... I knew Oswald. He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit. I taught him everything. A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch. I treated him good. He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal. The Agency fucked him. Just like they're gonna fuck me.
What about the mob, Dave? How do they figure in this?
They're Agency, too. Don't you get it? CIA and Mafia together. Trying to whack out the Beard. Mutual interests. They been doing it for years. There's more to this than you dream. FBI fucking hates the CIA. Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too. Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami. Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey. Colonel Roselli. The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop the bagman at Ruby's club. I heard he shot his own partner. Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt. He's dirty. That's all I know. But the Agency always runs the show. Check out something called "Mongoose" Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man check out Southeast Asia that's the next big number the heroin trail. "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Come in, Dave. Have a seat, make yourself comfortable. Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison? I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election. I congratulated you, remember?
How could I forget? You make quite a first impression. Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee? I've heard over the years you're quite a firstrate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small... I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know. Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
How could I? Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday. A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby. We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
That's not true. I never met anybody named Oswald. Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him. There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I'm sure you've seen this. Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got. Thanks for straightening it out for us. There is one other matter that's come up, Dave. We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yeah, now that's true. I drove to Houston.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing... the storm wasn't that bad.
I see. And where did you drive?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why Galveston?
No particular reason. Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right. We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them. But you couldn't approach them. They were a wise bunch of birds.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car. Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused. We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns. Stupid, right? So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see. Dave thank you for your time. I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why? What's wrong?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that? Banister's pet project. Getting paid by the government to work against the government. Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I don't know. Were you? Who you scared of, Dave?
Everybody! The Agency. The Mob. The Cubans. Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out. Here, in Dallas, Miami. Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle. My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba he's somewhere in Miami. You're on the right track.
Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Fuckin' A. How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Same one. I didn't know no impersonator.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Black, black just give it to me. Shit. I'm so exhausted. My neck is killing me. I've got cancer. Had it for years. I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly? Did you ever work for the CIA?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man highest clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans all Agency.
What about Ruby?
Jack? Jack was a pimp. A bagman in Dallas for the Mob. He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side. Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit we almost had Castro. Then we tried to whack him. Everybody's flipping sides all the time. It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Then who killed the President?
Oh man, why don't you stop. This is too fuckin' big for you! Who did Kennedy? It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma. Even the shooters don't fuckin' know! Don't you get it yet? I can't be talking like this. They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die! I don't know what happened. All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God. But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness. They defrocked me. And then I started to lose everything.
Shit! Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today. You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else. And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw. I hate the bastard. All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands. He tipped the newspapers I know it. That's how the Agency works. They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out. Now it's my turn.
Dave, it's going to be okay. Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you. I guarantee it.
They'll get to you, too they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man... I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning. We'll talk then.
Yeah, yeah. But leave me alone for awhile. I got to make some calls.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that he said...
I don't remember his name. You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
No.
But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others. There were admirals.
There were admirals.
Oh yes, there were admirals and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
What?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias. You know that. There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.
That's our case!
If that's your case, you didn't have a case. I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Well, I am saying it. Bring in the jury.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Sure it is. Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers. I'd catch hell. And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
Dad, look what I drew.
That's something, Jasper. What is it?
A rhinoceros. Can I stay up another hour?
Daddy! Where have you been?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Because of Kennedy? Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
I'm scared.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing. It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man. If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you and then everybody gets scared.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No, you don't!
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots. He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I want the truth.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots. I'm not going to lie for you.
...you heard echoes.
No. I had guns all my life. I used to go turtle shooting.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something. He got angrier and angrier and then:
Look, we can put you in a mental institution. We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
These new people never identified themselves. They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day. I guess I wasn't too hard to find wearing that red raincoat.
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.
That's impossible. You heard echoes ...echoes. We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there. He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
We have that taken care of. You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
I was scared. It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera. I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face. Ruby was just given a new trial. If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record. I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them. There are about 1200 documents... Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities can't get one of them. All classified as secret on the grounds of national security. It's real strange.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Makes sense he's a spokesman.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians. He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Don't get sidetracked! How does he get back to the States? That's the point. Does he have any problems?
None! The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an antiCommunist group.
And Marina? Does she have a problem getting out?
None either. It's bizarre. It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out. Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63. A man who has defected once already. It's crazy.
Dammit, it doesn't add up! Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return. Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at JaggarsChiles Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes. Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas all rabid anti Communists.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams. It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program. He used slave labor to build the V2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I wonder about the Williams'. Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44? No one knows. They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M. Who called? Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible." Who called? Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership when the Oswald we know is in Russia there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba? Guy Banister. Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks. Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Goddamn! They put Oswald together from Day One! Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas you just move him around a board. Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems. You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination. Does the real Oswald know he's been put together? Who knows. It doesn't matter, does it? He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
I don't believe it!
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans! It's outrageous!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right? It proves he's a liar. Keep on it, Bill.
This is interesting are you ready for this? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Aren't you being a little hard?
No, I don't think I am, Susie. Anyone else?
I'm sorry.
I know.
I'm not sure I understand.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
I wouldn't imagine where.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No. Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street. Do you recall that?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter a colored man. He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other which he found rather unusual because the table was so long. Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Not at all. But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other. That is precisely the point of a long dining table. The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then. I call him Smedley. His real name is Frankie Jenkins but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Pffft! Absolute nonsense. The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything. As you well know.
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
Who?
David Ferrie.
No. I have never known anyone by that name. Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
Let me show you his picture.
No. I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Clay Bertrand? Clay Bertrand? I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce. Is that the man you had in mind?
No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
One meets so many attorneys in my business. No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Naturally. Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Please answer the question.
Of course not! Such a pity, that assassination. In fact, I admired President Kennedy. A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal politicalespionage activities. It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I'm well aware of this asinine article. And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense. What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching. I am an international businessman. The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America. I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things. I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go? Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Now just a minute, sir! You're way out of line!
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car a blue Valiant. I'll never forget that day.
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
That's right. When I saw him on TV, I was shocked. I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered. My statements...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck." That's not true. I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not. And here... ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange. See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page? That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning. I guess that's all...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it? I can't believe it. A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Well maybe you're right, Jim. I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed. Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning. Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
One hour, y'hear? Some Saturday night date you are. Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Oh, she did, huh? When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Honey, you all right?
It's incredible, honey the whole thing. A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union. A Russian exam!
I cannot believe this. It's four thirty, Jim Garrison. I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test. Oswald was a radar operator. He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing. Oswald did badly on the test, he says. "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong." Ha! That's like me saying Touchdown here... ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake! You going to stay up all night every night? For what? So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you? Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier. That was no accident he was in Russia. He was probably in military intelligence. That's why he was trained in Russian.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim? Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter. He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face. I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
No. I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday. You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I'm sorry, but it's important. Clay Shaw is important. I'm sorry.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too. It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise. Go ahead without me.
Hi.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Liz, I'm really sorry. The meeting went much longer than expected.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake. It's Easter! You promised, Jim.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family! All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?" What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to tell them. How 'bout the truth I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Don't be. Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war this is nothing.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
A man just called. He asked her everything!
Honey, some crackpot. Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim! A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know? How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore! You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.
I'm leaving. I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving! I won't stand it anymore.
Honey, come on. The government wants you to be scared. They want everybody to be scared to speak out. They count on it. But there's nothing to be scared of.
You and your government! What's the matter with you? Don't you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are you?
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better. Spend a week. I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right? Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children. The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing. You didn't even notice he was there. He came to me bawling his little eyes out. Jim, he's sensitive he needs more from you.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Is it such a chore? I don't understand you.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him. I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you. You've changed.
Of course, I've changed! My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane! And now King. Don't you think this has something to do with that? Can't you see?
I don't want to see, goddammit! I'm tired. I've had enough! They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking. You're ruining this man Shaw's life! You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me all this time you never believed me.
Oh, I don't know anymore! I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government. I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well so do I, goddammit! So do I! I had a life too, y'know I had a life, too. But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth! It's not just about you and your well being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey." While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies! Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz! And yours is, too! And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison. I'm not making any threats. I'm leaving you. I'm taking the kids to my mother's. I am I am.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was. Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I don't think so, Jim...
They killed him, honey.
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy. They shot him down.
Oh no! No! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Call me Willie. I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison. Minutes, hours, days, years of'em. Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
For sexual purposes?
Well... yeah.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg. He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists. He's a butch John. You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap. You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years. So one night we were over at Ferrie's place. Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a doctor?
Fuck, yeah! I told you so. And you can tell'em all I told you so.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide. They can't buy me. You can't buy me. I don't even need the parole. This is about the truth coming out. You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass. Fascism is here now, Facism is...
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
You wanna know why? 'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why! Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country. Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'. Fascism's coming back. I tell ya this the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country. I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway. People should know why that sumbitch was killed. 'Cause he was a Communist. Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
What's wrong, Lou?
Boss, the President's been shot. In Dallas. Five minutes ago.
Oh no!... How bad?
No word yet. But they think it's in the head.
One little guy with a cheap rifle look what he can do.
Let's get outta here, Lou. I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
I know David a strange character.
He's been in trouble before. Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14year old boy.
Remember whose office this was back in '63? 531 Lafayette Street.
Yeah, Guy Banister. ExFBI man. He died couple years ago.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Take a look across the street.
Post Office.
Upstairs. In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI. What do they say?
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans. That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI. Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
What are you driving at, boss?
We're going back into the case, Lou the murder of the President. I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas talk to some people. Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. No record of them ever being questioned.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young.
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire. What's a cop wearing a headset for? I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Graveyard dead. August this year. A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas. The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
There was Rose Cheramie. A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Can we find her?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65. Two in the morning on some highway. A hit and run.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou. Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. Lou, come alive. These things are not adding up.
Mobbed up all the way. Tight with the Dallas cops. I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I know you do, Lou. I'm doing three more lectures this month. You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa. But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead. How did Jack Ruby dies so quick? Of what? Cancer, right? A history of Nazi Germany, Lou. They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's. We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis. Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located. Think about it. Think the unthinkable question everything.
Goddamn Sam!
And it ain't pretty ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
You don't get it, guys he can't go down any further. We got to protect him full time.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington. An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou. We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami. I gotta get him in, boss. I need more men I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
I took it once for a low thyroid condition... It raises the metabolism, Lou. Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I'd say the opposite hypertension.
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing. The other problem is there was a tree right there... Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Didn't Hoover say something about that? The leaves had fallen off in November?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it's leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance. Not one. And Oswald was at best a medium shot. The scope was defective on it, too. I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting. Nobody could. And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.
That means we gotta subpoena Time Life on it.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston? There's plenty of time he's out in the open a frontal shot?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
How many men?
One shooter. One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams. I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people. Hunters... patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "321... green!" Or else "Abort! Abort!"
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Beats me. City officials. Secret Service. Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before. But they didn't bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
You know who the mayor was?
No.
Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?
Who?
General Charles Cabell. Deputy Director of the CIA. Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor". When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him? Our friend Clay Shaw.
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Allen Dulles?
Head of the CIA since '53. Kennedy fired them both. Cabell was his deputy for nine years. Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop. Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou. Go home. While we're still a little behind. We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time. He's fighting everything.
We need him back.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it. I didn't ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou. I'll accept your resignation.
You sure got it. You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore. I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child." It's fuckin' outa control. Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Don't get me started on that. Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper. No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
I thought the FBI testfired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it! They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with worldclass precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers he wasn't any good. Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best. Here, the third shot's perfect. Don't make sense. And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet? That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day. You been duck hunting? I think Oswald was a good oldfashioned decoy. What'd he say? "I'm just a patsy." Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire. I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Honey, another one of these. This one's as weak as cricket peepee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media Time, Newsweek, our own NBC that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury. What is your response?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over. But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison they want the hard evidence! They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Are they? Why would they?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.
No, it can't!
Jim Garrison?
Yes.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I could give you a false name, but I won't. Just call me X.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you. But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say you're close, you're closer than you think...
I don't... I can't believe it. They killed him because he wanted to change things. In our time in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me. Don't trust me. Do your own work, your own thinking.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse. You, too. I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging. Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy. That's important it's historic.
I haven't yet. I don't have much of a case.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town. You're some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks. Be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack. Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
Well, thanks for coming.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it started?
I think it started in the wind. Money arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia. As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia. Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere Houston, New York hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
He's done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro. No big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams. Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop? Part of the scenery. The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...don't think so. When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em. These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza! They took out the President of the United States! That's entertainment! And they served their country doing it.
...and your General?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA. Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Ever ask him?
You never ask a spook a question. No point. He'll never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
His name?
Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know? That picture of yours. The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
I knew the man 20 years. That's him. The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring. What was he doing there? If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered. And in fact they were you never heard of them again.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did.
Just think... just think. What happened to our country .. to the world... because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Here's my problem, Jack. You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Yet on November 22, 1963 the day of the President's murder our police report says he pistolwhipped you with a .357 Magnum. But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it. Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy we were friendly, you know heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
I didn't say that. All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. I wasn't really part of the operation, you know. I was handling the privateeye work for Guy when that came in not much did but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse. There were all these Cubans coming and going. They all looked alike to me.
Dave Ferrie you know about him?
Was he there often?
Often? He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Where is Banister in all this?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain. Ferrie handled a lot of the training. There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba. A few Americans got trained, too. Nazi types. Mercenaries. But Ferrie was the craziest.
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
And Oswald?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut. Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie. But he was there all right.
Anything more specific, Jack? It's important.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know like a society guy. Can't remember his name. Oswald was with him.
Clay something, that was his name Clay.
Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?
Yeah! That's it. I don't know. Maybe it wasn't. I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand. He's in the Warren Report. He tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure. 'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
The assassination, Jack?
Never. Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go. I said enough. I said all I'm going to say.
Hold on, Jack. What's the problem?
What's the problem? What's the problem? Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
You're so naive, mister.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them. The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets. Or fake secrets.
Even my own wife, chief, Who's wondering where I am?
Even your own wife, Numa. Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
You just need some sleep, Lou. It won't look so bad when...
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful. All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Okay, you handle it, Numa. I don't have time for this nonsense. We've obviously got the bastards worried now. I'm going to Washington.
No, she could get hurt. If you believe what's happening to these other people.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I just don't want to do it. What else?
Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years. Well, maybe that's good news it was never as good as combat, but this is. Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
He'll never make it. If he wins, they'll kill him. He wants to avenge his brother. He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
I don't think so, Al. You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"? The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in. But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
It's a means to an end. This war has two fronts in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Welcome, Mr. Miller. Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I'm glad you could find time to see me. I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you and I have the means to back up what I say.
We can use all the support we can get. I think these might interest you.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Splendid, love to see them.
Where were you? Europe, Pacific?
Germany.
You were lucky. I spent three years in the Pacific. I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bailbonding companies. Why is that?
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence. We...
I know about that shot. A terrible tragedy. How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess. Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's all you've had all this time?
That's it.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you. But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion. You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good. You don't belong here. On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Nonsense. You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world. Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent. Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
And what would I have to do?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with. The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Hello. Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest. Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then. How old are you?
Six.
And how tall are you?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Uh huh.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here? In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing I am going to have some lunch.
Can I make a statement? If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that? Can you take me with you?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
What are they?
Well, the public attention it would attract. And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing. Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time. My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now and the truth serum how do you pronounce it Pentothal whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Can I help you?
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
This looks pretty good on me.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Not a problem.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit get out of that damn uniform.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I understand.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
I understand.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Yes, Max, I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
I won't forget.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.
Who?
You.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just you know smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor then BAM hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
What's the problem?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Uhhuh.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Go ahead.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there ten minutes.
Uhuh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I can't believe you do me this way.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it
Look, man, I know I owe you
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Course you didn't.
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
In his inside coat pocket.
Why were you with him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
You got a good lawyer?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
Great, you're here.
Hey, Jackie.
What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
She knows it's my case?
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
We are. Don't worry about it.
Every step of this goes in my report. I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, onehundred dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
What time do you have to be there?
Can I have a word with you?
Sure.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
I doubt it. Who's your friend?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Suspicion of what?
This is your money?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not saying another word.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Arrest me.
I'm not a loser.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're fortyfour years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttlefucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelvethousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Help yourself.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
Beauty products.
What's this?
That's my diet shit.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Thanks.
Help us do what?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
But now you're telling us now you do.
'Course I do I deliver money for him.
You don't want much, do you?
Can you do it or not?
How was your flight?
Fine.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Okay.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Who do you think I am?
I gave you my card there.
Can I see your I.D.?
You're serious?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
In cash.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Great.
You gain weight?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
What's your brand?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
Was she helpful?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
You're not tired of it?
I am, as a matter of fact.
What have they told you?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?
Sure.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
What did they want to know?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
He's the one who wants you.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it That don't give me much to bargain with.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
What'dya think?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
If you're having some.
I am. Have a seat.
You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Black's fine.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
What, I couldn't hear you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Somebody loan it to you?
Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
Sure.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
It looks nice.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
This is pretty.
Uhhuh.
Who is this?
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
It's nice.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a halfa million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
Why?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Really?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
How'd you feel about it?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
It's different with men.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Yeah.
Does something else worry you?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Well, hello.
Surprise.
I walked right past you.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
No... ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Does it happen to all men?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
And Annette's it for you?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Who was your girl before Annette?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
I don't care.
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You don't actually do it that way?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
Will Ordell go for that?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
I see.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Has he hinted around?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
He tries to act cool.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What about you Max?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A halfamillion dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind I guess it was Thursday.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Uhhuh.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
And is that it?
More or less.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Which one?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a halfmillion dollars, would you take it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
What if I've figured a way?
The feds. It's evidence.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
You're rationalizing.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
He won't I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
How'd you find out?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
He's liable to shoot you.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Ray wants him.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
It's not that simple.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uhhuh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I got your package. It was fun getting a halfamillion dollars in the mail.
Less ten percent.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it if you're sure that's all you want.
I'm sure.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I told him I might.
That's Ordell's.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Not after they're dead.
I didn't use you, Max.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
I'm fiftyfiveyears old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
You'll get over that.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Wanna go?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Are you scared of me?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at onethousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twentyfive thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Do you live together?
Most of the times.
Not every day?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yes'm.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Yeah?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
What the fuck is that shit?
I know what it looks like.
You planted that shit on me.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
We'll just be a minute.
Can I smoke?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
We can look into that.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
You know what we want.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Oh, so now you know him?
You never asked me if I did or not.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
What are you doing?
I'm recording this.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
A Broadway shopping bag.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You talk to him?
Not really.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
...Compton with a fiftysixyear old petty thief woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uhhuh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uhhuh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
You said that the last time.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were nofiled this morning in Circuit Court.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
I never have. It's not my money.
Ever been tempted?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Uhhuh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Si.
I thought I did.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a toughlooking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile andahalf from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Sure.
Great... ...Wanda!
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uhuh.
Gimme one anyway.
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
He said he didn't know about it.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag Is it tempting?
You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Halfamillion dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I was expecting you. Come in.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Got some o.j.?
Yeah.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
Sure.
For what?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
They asked.
And what was your answer?
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Yeah?
I didn't tell 'em anything.
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
They told me.
What do you think it is?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
What the hell you doin'?
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
Go sit over in that chair.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
I just came here to talk.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
Yeah?
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
I got a problem...
All your money's in Mexico.
Yeah.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
It's a cockatoo.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
I do okay.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
How the fuck they know that?
I told them.
You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
You told them that?
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the halfmillion they don't give a fuck about that They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
What did they say?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
That's a good idea.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
But you don't?
No, I give it to someone else first.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes you got somebody yet?
Uhhuh.
Who?
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Drink?
I need to talk to you alone.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither. No answer?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Designer clothes.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car mission accomplished.
Where you gonna be during all this?
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddybuddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
Want a hit?
Sure.
When did you get out of jail?
Four days ago.
Where at?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uhhuh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Is it ready to go?
Yeah, there's another hit left.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air in this case smoke to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
Want a Metrix?
What's a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
No thanks.
Which one?
The roller disco one.
Fourteen.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
Were you a disco guy?
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Must of made quite an impression.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That sounds like a problem.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
Wanna fuck?
Sure.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Is it dead?
Yeah.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went?
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Does that bother you?
Please.
You live with him.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that halfmillion dollars he's got in Mexico?
Uhhuh?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uhhuh?
...and just take it from him.
We're leaving now!
All right already.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Are you sweating?
What are you doin'?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Lemme have the bag.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
I'm carrying it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Is it this aisle, Louis?
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
You sure?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Okay, Louis.
Thanks, Baby.
Who's your partner?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelvefifty.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
I got me five M60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a halfa million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another halfmillion.
Then what?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Sure. We almost done, ain't we?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Which one is for the car?
This one's for the ignition... ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Okay.
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
The moon I dunno
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nastyass welfare motel.
You're outside?
Uhhuh.
C'mon in.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
I'm in my underwear.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a halfamillion dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em. Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
I follow.
I didn't look like a bum.
But you did have a Salvation Army thing going.
How much is there?
Over halfmillion dollars worth of merchandise.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
Sure.
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteenyearold country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
She believed you?
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
I told you, man. She my fine little surfer gal.
Uhhuh.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
It's Louis.
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time
Not now, pick me up.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. Hey, where's Melanie?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
So what, you left her there.
I shot her.
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uhhuh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a halfamillion.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a halfamillion dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Fuck you for asking me that.
Pull the car over.
What'd you shoot her with?
It's in there.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Or... ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Jesus Christ.
What?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.
I didn't really think anything of it. No I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Max Cherry.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed halfamillion dollars Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
I'm going out for a few hours.
Hold on a minute. Where you going?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Watcha gonna see?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Have fun.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
They don't have your winning personality.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
How can I help you?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
That's Winston. He works here.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
So, you want a tenthousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You have it with you?
It's in my bag.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
I know that.
Who's it for? A relative?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkeyass had a pistol on him.
Ten thousand sounds high.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
You think you could do that?
What's his full name?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Getting there.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Beaumont Livingston.
Livingston, huh?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
You don't say.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I need your name and address.
Ordell Robbie. ORDELL. ROBB IE. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House or apartment?
House.
Now I need you to count your money.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign?
Hey, Max.
Yes.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I?
Comfortable?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
It still sounds high.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
Somebody already did.
What?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out hey, that rhymes blew Beaumont's brains out.
Did the police contact you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that wherethere'ssmokethere's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Was she?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
If there's no what do you call it confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Just listen for a second. We got a fortyyearold, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit and mind you, I said "if" it was just her shit to get high with.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Where is it?
Is that what I think it is?
What's up with this shit.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
You know who this is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
She got off, huh?
They decided to nofile. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
You still there?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
I'm alone.
Git your ass in here.
That's all?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter ramming the door right now.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
How the fuck did he find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uhhuh.
Well, give it to me then.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
In a way, yes.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
This place stinks.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
My office.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
That I gotta see.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
You expect me to just walk in there?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blondeheaded little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uhhuh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
She will.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
My money's in that office, right?
Uhhuh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.
You sure?
Yes.
You better be, motherfucker.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
You know it's for you.
Who is it?
It's Beaumont.
We're back.
'Ola!
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Hahaha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Hello. Hey, Jackie... No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
I was gonna tell you...
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
No problem.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He ain't here right now.
He leave town?
He's around.
Give me his home number.
I'll give you his beeper.
Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home? This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know. This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
Remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Dream on!
No! Oh God.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
No, thanks.
It's fun.
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
Della?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Like Della.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
No, don't. But thanks.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
How do you know?
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Yeah, ever since that ...
Grass never did that to me.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Me, too.
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
LET GO!
You have an unusual hand.
I could have told you that.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Just my luck.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Hello.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
That's right. We did.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
There's nothing to expose.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? What's going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others?
They're not interested, Jake.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe? What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
Don't go.
Don't go? I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Oh yeah? What am I Perry Mason here?
Doctor. Ph.D.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I am.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You need ... a doctor.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Why do you say that?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
But the paper ...
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
What else did he say, Jake?
What do you mean, demons?
He told me he was going to Hell.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
How long had that been going on?
A couple of weeks, I think.
He say what they looked like?
No. Not really ...
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
You think they're connected?
I think something's fucking connect ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
... I've seen them, too.
Shit!
Dr. Carlson's dead?
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Not me, buddy.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
I say you should get a shrink.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
Turn on your right side. How about the other "right?" I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Who?
Sarah.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She told you that? Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
She hates me, Louis.
You should go back to her.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I can't relax.
Wiggle your toes.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I had this weird flash just then.
What?
I don't know. I've been having them recently. You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
Louis, you're a life saver.
I know.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You ever read Meister Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Perfect. We got it. Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
What? By myself?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
What are you doing?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Are you in the service?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
It's good to see you.
Likewise.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Last I heard you were offered a posi tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub lime intellect she's living with?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. I need to know about ... demons.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No. I see them.
See them? What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.
I know very little about demons, Ja cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob, this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy chiatrist?
Yes. I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I don't know what to say.
I need your insight, your intuition.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please help me.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
But I see them.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob. You wanna know what I'd do if I sud denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Hell, you think I am?
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out patient program. He knows me.
What's your name?
Jacob Singer.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
What was that?
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Jacob, what can I do?
Save me!
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Your back? Did you fall?
They stole it.
Who did?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
No. Don't move me.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where to?
That help?
Thanks.
What do you think?
What do you mean?
The room!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
What happened to you?
Don't ask.
You up?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Did you look around the headboard?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Thanks. What's that?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
And look what I got.
The best.
I must have been out of my head.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What's in here?
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah? I can see what you mean.
What?
Why you left.
What do you mean you can see?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
She looked good then.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
Is that the one who died?
Gabe.
Wait. Don't.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I just want to look ...
Ready?
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Jake!
How's it going?
I'm going home.
What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
When was the last time I said a word?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
It's still there, Jake. Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They're like demons, Jez.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
They weren't human!
Come on. What were they, Jake?
You okay?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
Where?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
Can't you stop it?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
What the hell are you doin'?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off!
What'd the doctor say?
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
He's coming right over.
Coming here?
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
That's your decision.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
I can't do it.
What kind of man are you?
Don't gimme that.
Lie down!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Help me! Help me!
Here. I'll do it.
Jake. You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Are we in Brooklyn?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest. The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello! Anybody home? Anybody in there?
What?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a little?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
We're all angels, you know ... ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
I love you, Jez.
I know.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Remember that.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How come? The army?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I don't believe this.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I want to know. You tell me!
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I can do anything I want.
Don't!
It might be for me.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Who was that?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How?
I have no idea. I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
What's gotten into you?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's so hard to believe.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Stick with me, kid.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Please.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
What's going on?
Your capacity for selfdelusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Why won't you answer me?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You sonofabitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
What'd you do that for? It's an in teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis ten.
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
Midtown mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh? Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
This isn't happening.
Your capacity for selfdelusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Oh God!
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
Goddamn you!
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know who I am.
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Long time ago.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Shows how much you knew.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
The Ladder?
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, HuntleyBrinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Like it was yesterday.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Who then?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
So why tell me now?
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
You come here often?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Never?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
What is it?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I don't know.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out your tongue. That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
One drop?
It's strong stuff.
I think I'm falling asleep.
Pleasant dreams.
I can't move.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Well that's good to know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
I don't know what to say.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet? Excuse me. Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
I no from around here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
How 'bout over there? No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
They're awfully heavy.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
Where's Wong?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
No. I'll take the other one. Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
If you're lucky.
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Please come quietly.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
We're not going to hurt you.
Clear the area. This is an order!
What is wrong with you?
Dream on!
What?!
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
I'll page him.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go? She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
Paul! You sonofabitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I need to see you, Jake.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
I need to see you.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
I work in a bakery.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Count 'em on one hand.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Still married, Jake?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What's wrong?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That black car?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Who is?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything. Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
The army?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I don't know. I don't know.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
You come home with me.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Do you want me to get someone?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
I have some ice from the machine.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Pour it in.
On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Punk?
That's nine to four, geekboy.
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Pause play.
He's not part of the program.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Yes it does.
Oh, come on!
Okay, enough of this shit.
Alright, asshole.
I don't have all day, kid.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Duck fuckers?
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What do you mean, not enough time?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
We're not leaving Crutch!
We don't have time to argue!
Goodbye old friend.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Could you show a little compassion?!
It's locked!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
What are you doing?!!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
No.
What's that?
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
We don't have a choice!
Can we blow it with just two?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
His mother?
What?
I don't know. Nothing.
Minimal.
We made it?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it reaches the core, we're done.
Done?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Yeah, yeah. Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Bomb?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Rizzo did.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Sergeant!
Get out of here!
Uhoh.
What?!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Okay that hurt.
Thorgan, pull us in.
Where have you been?!!
He....He...
Where the hell were you?!!
He came for me, I had to run!
Creepy.
Cool.
Nice touch.
And you said high school was boring.
You see that?
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Better let me.
Where'd you get the gun?
Everyone okay?
I think I broke my arm.
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
We're not supposed to do that.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
I'll need system four converters.
They're back here.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
KayEm!
What are you doing back?!!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Two more charges to go.
Done!
Let's move out!
Goodbye, my love.
Thorgan, suit up.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
We'd need charges.
We could convert fission transistors.
How many?
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Where is...?
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then stop talking and work faster!
Then what do we do?!
I don't know!
Hurry!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
It bought us some time.
And now we're all out of it.
Earth II.
Suit up.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Hey, easy now.
Get them in the lab!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two
Jesus what the hell is that?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
What the hell are you doing?
My job.
Fine, just stay out of my way. Hit it.
Wait a minute...I need...
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Not a chance.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
You got that right.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
You just keep an eye out.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
But I didn't see...
Sergeant!
What?
I'm with you kid.
Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
We need weapons.
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Jesus, God!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Roger that. Time to kick some ass!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Fuckin A...
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Kicker, anything?
Negative.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Pull me in!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Where are you going?
We have to get off this ship.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, EX Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
I hope so.
Outta here?
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. Last chance.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
No you don't!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's medkit or he'll die.
Medkit?
I guessed.
We're screwed!
400 years in the future and these peashooters are the best you can do?!
What if you miss?
What if we don't?
Rizzo?!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Hey.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey!!
What's this?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
That's why I'm here.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
I thought you meant...
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Were you close to your father?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
And what happend to ...?
I couldn't save them.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
See? We're not so bad.
Not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
You?
Wait around on your asses all day. I'll need a distraction.
Got it. You ever space walked?
Oh sure, all the time.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Eat me.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Okay, good tip.
You'll be fine.
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Did you like it?
I think so, why?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I know you.
Rizzo, pull away!
I'm stuck!
You okay?!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I get it.
Now what?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Spunky . . .
She broke my fucking nose!
Well?
She needs a little time.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
That's really funny.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Oh I like her a lot.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
No shit. I got no problem with that.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the shuttle.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Yuck.
We're screwed.
Gogogogogo!!!!
He's right behind us!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I'm on my way.
Kaboom.
Again?! Jesus!
Okay?!!
Just come on, I've got an idea.
I'll help you in.
KayEm, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Well, do something!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Shut up, Thorgan!
Push off toward us.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
They'll make it.
Close the fucking door!
NO!
And what's with the headgear?
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twentytwelve.
Now that's just gross.
GO, GO, GO!
Now this is getting exciting.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
You must shut down the engines.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
I'm missing two!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found. Adrienne! Stoney!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Just get us to the ship!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
We've got a situation here! Just do as you're told!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Thank you.
This is what it means right here.
Small brains make your balls itch?
I'm gonna spew.
That ought'a help the situation.
You think it killed . . . Yeah, I guess not.
Let's just get out of here.
Hurry! She's lost it!
So what else is new?
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
Would you?
You're so bossy.
You're leaving me here alone?
You're quicker than usual.
Later.
You prefer an apple?
Jesus!
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
What are you doing?
Jesus! Can't you knock? Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
What do we do?!!
Crutch?
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Maybe she tripped.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
No.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I'm just saying.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I don't know...sorry?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Robot huh?
Kayem 14.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
You need to get laid!
No... That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Are there any other shuttles?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
You killed him?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
In twentyeightytwo many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Oh shit! There he is!
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Am I in there?
Sory...
It's just you and me, then.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Almost done.
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Sorry, sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?
Good point.
Do I have to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Oh, alright.
KayEm, you okay?
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
You did good, KayEm. I'm proud of you.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
KayEm we made it!
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
Kayem you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
I love you.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
We're missing two of the kids!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Kicker!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Leave him behind!
No! He's coming with us!
I don't understand...what does he want?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
What?
Ssh.
How do you know?
I just know.
Something's wrong.
Keep trying!
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
Damn! Close the door! I'll be right back.
What?!!
I gotta go back.
But?!!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
I'm sending you the files.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Alright, I'm . . . No way . . . is this a joke?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
See you then . . . doctor.
Where..? Who . . .? I'm alive. You brought me back.
Obviously so.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We've had NanoTech for the last 30 years.
30? How long was I out?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
But...I...400 years?
That's right, now if you could...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Are you finished?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryostatis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
I didn't say he was alive.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Get him out of there!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?
Are we locked down?
What good will that do?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Guys, please come with me!
4You're not going anywhere.
How do you open the damn door?
You're crazy!
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Three...two...one...
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Old Earth?
What have you done?
What have I done?! Idiots.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Exactly.
Yes!
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Can we get through these?
Sure but what good will that do?
Guys, he's right behind us!
It's okay.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did?
Son! Out of the water now!
My boat's neat, dad!
I want him out of the ocean.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Sure, Dad.
My cars. And a comic book.
Here Take him home.
Did you bring a check?
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
This is Matt Hooper...
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What do you mean 'We...?'
It's my charter. My party.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.
You got it.
Keep that chum line going we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
You got it?
Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick!
The wire's showing!
Unbuckle me fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never
What's the point with hooks and Lines?
Don't tell me my business! Quartermile, that way. Full throttle.
How if they're gonna keep on breaking?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
I never saw one that big.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Let's call in we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Look a' that Bayonet Iwo Jima.
C'mon. Middle appendix
I almost had 'im.
What's that one, there?
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Where...?
The bilge pumps. There
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Did you get him in the head?
No! No! No! Swing around! After him!
What about us?
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have you ever had one do this?
No!
He's trying to sink us!
Dead astern! Zigzag!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Full throttle! To port!
He's comin' up !
He's taken him!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Right.
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Like you're from N'Yawk.
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
I never hear the whistle.
Feed the dogs.
You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep it's mostly your city clothes.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it.
Don't be silly � You're going to make summer better for them...
Don't forget these.
Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh?
I think they make you look sexy.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Older, sillier.
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know � sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Be careful.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Love ya.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
You're very tight, y'know? Right there.
Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Can you stand something to eat?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Michael! Come inside!
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
How come you have to tell them that?
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
You too, sweetheart...
Thank you.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Can you do that?
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come?
Home... New York?
No. Home here.
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about I'll survive this.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Yohoho and a bottle of rum.
What'll I tell the kids?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Do I need any more authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans half this island are his cousins.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Only 24 hours!
I didn't agree to that!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Sure he is.
Who's that young man?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Be reasonable, boys this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of halfassed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need?
She's right.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I'm going home.
He lost it on the way up.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need noncorrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can reopen the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
Got a pen on you?
Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Maybe we can save August...
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish bellyup in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs.
My kids were on that beach...
Just sign it, Larry.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Who are you?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in midthorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. did you notify the coast guard?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical nonfrenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and postmortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. Did you go out in a boat and look around?
No, we just checked the beach...
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day beginner's luck.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
What d'ya mean?
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, whitetips... any one of them could've attacked. Look shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
Dynamite! How was your day...?
Swell.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Let's all have a drink.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Rogue?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
You could say that.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right her greatgrandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What stinks so bad?
Our friend, the shark.
What's that?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What? What?!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
...Nothing.
What do we do?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Chum?
Only one sure way to find him offer him a little something to eat. Chum blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
What is all this stuff?
Depthfinder, fathometer, sonar, closedcircuit TV fore and aft RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Can you tell from that if a big man eater is around?
Sometimes. Look here something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
Where'd you get all this?
I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We gotta get back soon...
What happened?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
They must've hit something.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
Why don't we just tow it in?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Be careful, for chrissake.
You all right?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
No shark did that to a boat!
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you can't avoid it!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
That means closing the beaches.
Wait a minute! I need you.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks.
I hope we get some more help.
I wish it would rain...
This has got to be one big violation...
This is quite a place.
What's that, a ship?
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
What the hell?
It's a whale out there.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Quint...?
No... You think we can get back with those?
What day is this?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I can't imagine why.
Christine what?
Worthingsly... Worthington no one ever died on me before.
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
You here for the summer?
Some friends and me took a house.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Pretty stiff.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We never had any. What's the problem?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there � take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
That wasn't funny.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
We're not even sure what it was.
What else could've done that?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend outoftown papers. Amity people could take care of this.
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
You wanna call it a night after here?
It's only twothirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Leg of lamb this time?
Screw lamb let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait
One more after this, then I'm going home.
Set?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Twenty years.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Look at him take it!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Let him do it! Gogogogogo!
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
So would I. Come on in.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Is anyone having this...?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
Is it! The bestfunded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
Well... is everything all right?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
What have you got there, Lenny?
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I just found out about it but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Transpacs
Transplants?
and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Let me see your hands...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of halfassed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there a portable shower?
AntiShark cage.
Who's inside, you or the shark?
What's that supposed to prove?
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Watch it! Compressed air you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
Hey, you! Farmer! Halfspeed there...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Gettin' ready to run again no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Down here, Hooper!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Look you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
I'm okay...
Fasten the pole.
Over there!
What do you see?
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Ever see one like this?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here
I'll drink to your leg.
And I'll drink to yours.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice your first and your last.
I think I can top that, Mister...
Don't tell me 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon what?
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
The shaft is giving.
Coming right to us!
No comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on Slower! Throttle back
He's heading under !
No way! He can't!
Follow him!
He's under!
What can that gun of yours do?
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
I don't have it.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little painthappy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Thanks for the message.
You know how I feel about her.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Cool.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses colorsafe bleach.
Go Carole. So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm supposed to be running.
I know.
So, what do you think we should do?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Whose idea was it?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Charisma?
Or something.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
What's up?
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I miss it too.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnanter these days.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Really? What are they like?
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Is that normal?
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Oh. That's a relief.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Jesus, Bleek.
Well, I do.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Um, hi?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
We're getting a stretch limo.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
You're being really immature.
What?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No...
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Wait, let me take that.
Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.
Why?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite onecalorie breath mint.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
What, you mean as friends?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
It does?
Wizard!
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Mine too.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
Okay.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I don't really know anything about it.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
No... I guess not.
What is your job title, exactly?
Excuse me?
I said, whatisyourjobtitle, Missy?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
What are you talking about?
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
Nails? Really?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a PopPop.
You're not going to be a PopPop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Oh, God...
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
No.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Cool it.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Listen, Brenduhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You don't know anything about me!
I know enough.
We don't even have a dog!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Wow, dream big!
Oh, go fly a kite.
Ow, ow, fuckityow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a BandAid.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
No.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Viscera?
Blood and guts.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Shut up.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
When was this, like '96?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Nuhuh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
You weren't even alive!
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Right. I hear they can be kind of a timesuck.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herbinfused juices?
I don't know. Something to do with the fourpacks... ...They're not bad.
Why aren't you at work?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I wrote that.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
You're kidding!
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
No, he's the dad.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuterbabies that's born without junk.
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
We definitely want it to have junk.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
What is it?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Hey, I like this.
This album is all Carpenters covers by altrock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
You don't have to do that.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a threeway tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
The Wizard of Gore?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yinyang.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
That suits you.
Uh, thanks.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
You're something else.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing momtype rage.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Why?
Cold feet.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those Tshirt guns at sports events.
Hello?
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Cute?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Consider it your musical education.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Go learn something.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
Cool.
Come on, I have something for you.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
You're gonna like this, I promise.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
What?
I actually know this one.
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Oh, okay. Like this.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I don't know.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No.
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
What's the matter?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the bigass bump!
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
But you're old!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
This... ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
God, you're so young.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total aholes!
Uh, hi SuChin.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
You should try Adderall.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
I heard that was you.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Really? Fingernails?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Vanessa, right?
Can I take your coats?
Sure.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. The powder room down here is being retiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Room with a toilet, got it.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh really?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
I went to the doctor today.
Is the baby okay?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
What...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Oh my God...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
No...
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Um... Juno, can I Can I touch it?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Oh my God It moved! I felt it!
Elbow.
Wow! It's magical.
Juno? What's going on?
Nothing.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Your name, please?
Juno MacGuff.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Congrats.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixtyfour ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirtyodd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Who is the kid?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
What?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Excuse me?
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm illequipped.
Hi Dad.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Yeah, she does.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Yeah, like people in love.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, no!
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Please stop now.
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
I sort of already have.
Well, of course. Your old DAD! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
What?!
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Or...
Thundercats are go!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Well, you know where the lavatory is. You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride! These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Yoyoyiggityyo.
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
That is sick, man.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
Aha! You love him.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
It was magnificent, man!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and SuChin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other." "All that's missing is your bastard."
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
You're not listening to me.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I was thinking a graphic designer, midthirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the BandAid and let it bleed.
I'm pregnant.
Check out Baby BigHead. That kid is scary!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Touche.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Aw, please Junebug?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Or stage parents!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Share the love, Tits!
Hly shht!
What?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
No way! She's pretty.
You sound shocked or something.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Right, seriously.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Hot!
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Keith's hot.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't say.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
So. What's that thing?
A Pilates machine?
What do you make with that?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You guys are playing music?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something genderneutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Why do people think yellow is gender neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessertcolored walls.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Hm.
Can you see it?
Juno, what's the matter?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What are you referring to?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then boom Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
She answered our prayers.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
What would be a good time for you?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Don't mock me.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jetlagged. We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
We'll talk at home. You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I know, Mom. It was great... really.
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
I know... But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
That's not really the point.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom?
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Hey, you guys back already?
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice!
Daddy...
Daddy...
Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie?
Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
It's cut.
cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails.
This doesn't make sense.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Goddamn right I did. I asked for a toughasnails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What's the point in having a speech if I have to adlib?
It was a good adlib, sir.
Thanks. Wrote it last night.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
But they start executing hostages in
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, this is AF135RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Roger.
That's affirmative.
Ga get it.
We've already been inspected.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and... refuels in midair. Call the White House.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
We copy. Stand by... Tower?
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs. Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One. This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
And all these rooms here?
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Thank you.
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
What do you want with us?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Now, or he dies, please.
Come on, Alice.
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers halfway around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
That was war.
So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...
Jim...
Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness. You were a hostage to everyone else * long before you were a hostage to
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Hold on, Alice.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Finally, we can bargain.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Our KHll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
They've gotta be joking.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Gravity.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane...
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
I'll not going without my family.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.
That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl. She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
How did your speech go?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.
Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
Both of you.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it?
White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
One.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.
* We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you... I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
It's bait. Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.
That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.
Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twentyfive years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!
We're hooked. Hove into position.
No.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
You lose!
I suppose anything's possible.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele for god sake please lis...
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Hi, I'm Adele.
Carrie.
...Pardon?
...I said, I like your hair.
...Thank you.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Karma.
What?
Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
That French ain't it?
Are you takin' the pictures?
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Not really.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Yeah, sure.
You dropped this.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
So you don't do any of those things.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
He whips you?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
How'd you meet Early?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You can?
I'm cool.
Could I try that?
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.
You took this picture?
Took 'em all.
That's me.
No it is not!
Hold still.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Yeah.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's Early been in jail for?
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
What?
That's not true!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Happy birthday Adele.
Early, you are so sweet.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Almost.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What'll we do out there?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
I heard that.
What if they're dangerous?
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Shush, Adele.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, sing me a song.
Early, what're you doin'?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... Do it Adele... Now!
What the hell is this stuff?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Yeah but, what is it?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
...thank you.
Thank you for what? What are you thanking me for Adele?
...I don't know.
Well Adele... it was for... ...saving your fucking life back there!
What's wrong with her?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Early! Stop!!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What's your name, boy?
Walter Livesy.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Where you from Walter?
Vernon, Florida.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey mostly.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
What do you need a Bible for?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
No sir.
Tight fit.
Best kind.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Brian.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
So what do you do Early?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Too bad.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
This the book your writing?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Who?
Henry Lucas.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
That bad?
...Then some.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Yeah.
You wanna hear mine?
Sure.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Nah... how much money have you got?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
Ya see what I'm sayin'? Ha!
...Ha.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Hell it don't... ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
So tell me... what happened here?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
...and?
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
You two been busy in here.
What happened to Adele?
Well, let's put it this way. I need me a new woman.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Thank god!
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
A... I gotta go.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The party?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
...I do.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Thanks. What are you doing?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
So how's it going?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
...and I think I know why.
Why?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
A book on the warehouse murders?
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I like that.
I still think we should have met them first.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Funny, very funny.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Lighten up...
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
I heard that.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Carrie.
I don't want to talk about it.
All set?
Fuck!
Take your time.
Who said he's my good buddy?
You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
How do you know that?
She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
What is it?
Look again!
What's that?
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
There's more...
I'm finished.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Why, what did he do?
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Carrie... stop it.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Then try again,
Carrie, watch for Early.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
What about you?
I don't know.
Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.
Nervous?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LALA LAND.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr!
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Need a hand with those bags?
No, thanks, I can manage.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
No.
...never?
No, never. Excuse me.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Siesta.
Early, just think...
Shut your mouth.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Everybody just shut up!
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Who d'ya think you're foolin'? I know you better than you think...
...You're hurting me...
You were plenty hot.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...You know what I mean?
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Wasn't my fault...
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
What happened?
Who are you?
His Parole Officer.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Could be.
Where would we find him?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Without his car?
What about the owner of the house... ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...Diebold?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
How old you?
17.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yes.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Yes!
You're clean.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Now you gotta be careful.
Shit.
Was up bitch?
What do you think?
You fucked it?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Well, how was it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Yeah.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, that's the best.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Let me smell it again.
You know what else?
What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
How?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Yeah.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
To what? Virgins?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for lowlevel virgin seduction guys.
Shit.
What do you want?
Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
What for? That guys a dick.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Den less go Joe.
Telly.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Why?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
It is right.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It's no big deal, right?
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yep.
They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
You thirsty?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
The cartoon?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know. Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin Xrated "Wonder Twins"!
Can you do it man?
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yep.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yeah me too nigga.
I hate this game.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Man, this guy is really good.
He looks like my uncle.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah. She's only 13.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Yeah.
And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hardon.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Bet.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That.
Why I give pennies?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
What are you talking about?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Right.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Shut up.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
So really, it's good luck.
Good luck?
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Yeah.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Shut the fuck up.
How much you gonna take?
I don't know. How much do you want?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Fifteen for me.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yeah probably.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
You are?
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Nah.
Why not? You stink.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Hold up man.
Casper.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Casper, where is he?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You goin'?
Yeah.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I had a female vagina last night.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Na.
You sure?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
Man we fucked him up.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Yeah me too.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Yeah. Do it again.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
What?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Sup then? Sup?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Sup. Sup.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Is it cold?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
Yeah.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
You were?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
She won't? Why not?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. I can understand that.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Yeah?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Do you like kissing me?
Yes.
Uh huh.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Come on.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I like you too.
I'm nervous.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
How do you know?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
But I'm scared Telly.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Do you care about me?
Of course I do.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Who are they?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
What is it?
Bang up stuff.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
No, Fidget, I...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No...
Here. Swallow.
You know what I want to do?
Yeah.
What do I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why?
Because, you know why. You know.
Because your a virgin?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Why is that?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I wouldn't believe it?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change. I want to make you happy. That's all.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Do you care about me?
Of course I do.
Dance!
What?
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Telly is at Steven's?
I guess so.
How old are you?
15.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
One.
Were you protected?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
What?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
What?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Sorry.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Miss, would I be prying?
Everything is wrong.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No.
Am I getting warm?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Your a real philosopher.
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Hello.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Telly says was up.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You still mad at him?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
The pain. The fucking pain!
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Passion...
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Mine?
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I only did it once and...
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
I'm coming.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
What happened?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Do you know where he went?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Whah?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Whah is dissdee?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
Whah you say? Dissdee?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yep.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
And you don't get shit out of it.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yep.
Making love is like.
Sweet.
Yeah.
It's like...
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yep.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
You think so?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
He still does.
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
No.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
What?!
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Hi mom.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
But then I won't need your money.
That's right.
Mom.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
When are you gonna be back?
Not too late.
Fourthirty in the morning?
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
You want a wipit?
Nah.
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird makebelieve story that the whole world believes.
Yep.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Slow.
It's grandmother style.
Yeah.
It's very monotonous.
Right.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yeah.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
To come?
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
It was... it was.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Yeah.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
What man? What is it?
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
I can't man.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid. Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
OK.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip.
By yourself?
Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?
What kind of problem?
I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem.
What are you saying?
Casual.
Casual? You were boning her weren't you?
It wasn't serious. What's your problem?
You are! I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Oh, we'll be back. You can bet on it.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
No.
What do you mean, no?
He says it's a game. All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
His victims aren't random. It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
Morpheus.
What?
Not what who. Morpheus. The Greek God of dreams. Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Are you crazy?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him make him slip up.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
Maybe you should.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that?
You don't have an investigation without me. You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right?
I wouldn't know.
That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
What do you want?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No.
I used to. With my old man. He taught me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a lot harder than most people think. We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields. When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed. But they're crafty little devils. You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent. You ever smell Raccoon scent? Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy. He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it. You know why? Cause he can't help himself. The scent drives him. So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is lay down the scent and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is and once you're sure where he is you shoot the fucker.
You got it on the board.
No, I need the original note.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
He's not talking about himself.
Then what's he talking about?
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Then let's narrow it down.
Homesearchers.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
I was at the beach.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!
Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off.
It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Yes you are.
Get off me!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What?
The message! I figured out
Sit down!
You want me to what?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
It'll take hours. You can't make me do this.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
What are you talking about?
I gotta friend over there. He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records. You know, give him something to do.
What's the first street?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Run it down.
Debi Rutlege. Female. Caucasian. Twenty four. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Local?
No. She just moved here last month from Portland.
What do you think?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You think he's dirty?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
What was your relationship with her?
Take it easy. Both of you.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
No shit!
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Sorry.
Anything?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy. I think he's a first timer.
Check with the State. If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it. Nolan?
You still having a problem with this?
Yeah, I am. I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
We've checked. There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Sanderson?
I spoke to Jeremy. He's watching Sanderson's kid. Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Find him! I want to talk to him.
What is it?
It's a voice modulator.
Ready for round two?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.
You should be an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Why does he call Sanderson?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world. Who better to play a game with?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing but who called him today?
I don't know. Maybe there's two of them. Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Maybe you're reaching a bit? I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious? Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What was suspicious about him?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
But a hundred men could move him.
Don't fuck with us! Where did you go!
He was with me?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully... Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Oh, c'mon. We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson!
It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased.
We'll find the evidence.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Hello, Peter.
Who is this?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life. I want to play a game with you.
I haven't got time for this.
Hello, Peter.
Just a second. Hello?
Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I'm not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play?
Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
And what path is that?
We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.
What?
I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
Where is she?
You'll find her.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're not going to tell me that.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her God has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet."
Hello?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
You know her?
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you didn't know her.
I know what I said! She looks just like...
Just like who?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I'm just trying to play the game.
You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Then call them!
Just for that no hint today.
Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
Have you any idea what the message is?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing it very well.
You like to brag, don't you?
What?
You heard me. Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What makes you think I was there?
I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know. Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Hello.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2 e3.
I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. Have you figured out the message?
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything. Remember eventually revenge
you're hopeless! You can't even read a sentence! Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game ends tonight!
Hello, Peter.
You sonofabitch!
Emotional? I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
By that time the game will be over.
I've figured out the message.
No you haven't. And even if you had it doesn't matter. Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Please... wait.
The game's over. You lost.
It's me you want. Not her.
No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Goodbye Peter.
No! Wait!!
I know where you are.
Very good. How did you know?
The pipes.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
You told me. When you called you said she was in the other room. Drop the knife.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it.
You don't understand.
Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Don't you see? I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I washed them. Their crossing was peaceful.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down. Put it down, David.
Naw, it's all fixed. I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Thanks.
What's this?
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter. I hope you don't mind.
Of course not.
Sure. We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Can we correlate data? Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
No problem. We're in.
Okay. Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Nope. Nothing.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
D2d4... b1c3... and c1f4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Now what?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me. There can't be more than a handful.
There's three. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. The Boston...
Never mind. He died two years ago.
1985. Hans Korshaud.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
What is it?
New York. 1986. Viktor Yurilivich.
Computers. That's how you got into Homesearchers records. You can get into anything. But why? Why?
You still haven't figured it out, have you? You think that I've put you through an ordeal. My scars run so much deeper than yours.
What scars?
The scars on your chest. From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You might not have done it had you known.
You're damn right! I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
The police came to me for help. What could I do?
You could have been honest with me for starters. We work together. I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly. Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive
the same type as the girl who got killed. Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you
Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Fuck off!
Feeling better?
I just can't believe it.
You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before. This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
I'm just nervous. Sorry.
You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Come here.
He was watching you.
Yeah that's what we've always thought but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You're losing me.
You must be Erica.
Uh huh.
I'm Kathy.
Is your dad here?
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back. Would you like come in?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Not really. It's pretty boring.
That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
Boys.
Do you like my dad?
Of course.
I know he really likes you.
How do you know that? Did he say something?
No... but I can tell. A woman knows these things.
Okay. Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
My cheering section.
What are you doing up?
I can't sleep. My beds lumpy.
I see. You forgot to bring you're nightlight, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Okay.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Lutz. She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Has he gotten through to any?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
What is it, dad?
Nothing.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Thanks, David.
You ready?
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't. Not today.
But you promised.
It isn't Kathy.
Who's Kathy?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much. There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
Not that I can see. We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
There's no blood. Where's the fuckin' blood?
Bingo.
Anything?
Not much. I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
What about prints?
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
No Frank. No prints.
He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths. We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island. We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
That's great.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
Same as the others?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
Well?
Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
I'm busy right now.
It's important.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
And this Jeremy
Edmonds. I know. You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
No. I told him to. I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
But we heard him.
It could have been a tape. A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Kathy?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
What about the way he arranged the body?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy. Powercontrol killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them. Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it. But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders not the other way around.
Anything else?
Yes. Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I was thinking the same thing. He must be local. It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name. What about this?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
I don't think it matters. Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Meaning?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Call dispatch. Double the patrols. I want that area blanketed.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
I know that. I've seen the photo's.
This ain't no photo.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego. He thinks he's superior. The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
What did he mean by Huxley?
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night. They're all the same type. All moved into their homes within the last three months and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
It can't be a coincidence. The woman that owns it has a son. She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days. We're trying to locate him. There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week. We're checking that out too.
He moves around a lot. Why?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
That's a big area to cover.
As large as castles.
Yes. Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What time did he get there?
About a quarter to one.
He's right, Kathy.
What are you saying? That I'm seeing what I want to see? That I'm protecting a murderer? What?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
What does that mean?
And what if he's wrong. If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him. If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
We're going to work on the message.
This stinks! You want to know what I think? I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
The most logical choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Did you see his face?
No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her. Coming home at all hours of the night. A young girl new to the city. This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in. How long ago was that?
Ten days ago.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it. Did you know her?
Only in passing. To say hello to.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Here. I played Gregory Lutz.
I know. You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five. Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room. Here's one at 9:04 pm. It says: From Debi. Please call me at home.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing. Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I got it from the tournament directory.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
I don't know. I was afraid there'd be hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard. She's a psychologist helping us out.
We've already met. Haven't we... Doctor.
You want me to go with you? Maybe I can help.
That's alright. We'll take it from here.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street." We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Maybe, but I don't think so. I think it's just a tease.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
That's it?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs? Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Another one? What word did he leave?
"Is". Did you tell him about the institute?
As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
It doesn't make sense.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe I already have.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you. There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
That's all he needs. He's making the moves. It's an opening. I just can't remember the name. Okay, it's a game. He's starting it, so he moves first. He's white. e2e4.
It's a commercial area. No one lives there.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question. What am I?
A building?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
He uses castles...plural then says "can't move me." Singular. Not can't move us.
A shadow. What's as big a castle? As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Wait a minute. There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
That's got to be it.
Where were you last night?
Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.
I went out.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you? That's why he wants me out of the way.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Look, I'll do anything you want! I'll sign anything you want! Just send a car out to the hotel.
Alright, c'mon Peter. We're moving you to a cell.
I signed the confession. What about the car?
Did you send the car?
It's over, Peter. Let's stop the games. I'm not sending a car.
You opened with the English. Lutz won't use it. He opened his first game with it.
He knows you're aware of that.
Then I'll transpose.
On a variation, yes but it must be a variation that is unique.
I suppose you have something in mind?
It's a good play, but risky.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Is it serious?
Peter...
I've got be here for the police when they come. Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
You're always in the middle of a match.
I want to be the best I can.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
What do you see here?
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
No.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.
Bainbridge Books.
Hi, Sara. This is Doctor Sheppard. I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
I can check and call you back.
Thank you. I'm at 6397393.
We'll call you back.
Bainbridge Books.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard. I called you earlier about a book.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard. We called you back but you weren't home. We have the book.
Could you please do me a big favor? In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess. Could you look and tell me what they are?
Of course. Yes, here it is. Why, they're all the same?
What are they, please?
"Carefully". "Carefully". "Carefully".
Sorry. I thought it was empty.
It's alright.
Is this your first time here?
Yes.
I love this hotel. I stay here every time I visit my parents.
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are?
No. I don't.
Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess. I don't have the patience for it. When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish.
but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
That's a very personal question.
I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
It is.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
Well, I think I've had enough.
Getting too hot in here for you?
What are you looking for?
Nothing. I just came in for a steam.
No you didn't.
They couldn't break the riddle.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
We need your help.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key. The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now. I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
What if she isn't? Where are your priorities? You have to think between someone's life and a chess game? The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old! He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I don't think I could.
It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat.
You sound like my mother.
It wasn't intentional.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Oh, but it is. He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him. That's a game. It has rules and objectives.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
That's true but the emotion is still there. They just learn to control it.
What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Of course.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
I'm just curious.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions I want to keep things on a professional level.
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
Very good. Spoken like a true psychologist. When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations. What is that Masters and Johnson?
You have to win every point, don't you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone? Let me ask you something? Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Of course.
Why?
Because I work with them.
No.
You're not?
No I'm not involved. And I plan on keeping it that way.
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
How could you? Unless you were there.
I know you didn't
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Doesn't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
No. But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me. What about you?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No. You were talking about chess.
Alright. What about me?
I dunno. Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It's alright. It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.
And you?
What?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I'm not playing a game now.
Yes you are. You're playing word games.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What? By attacking me?
Nobody could attack you. You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. You're cut off from everyone around you.
What are you talking about? You don't even know me.
Does anyone?
I just don't want to fight with you.
Then show me who you are.
This frightens me because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You can turn everything around so easily. This is not just another game, is it?
No.
I'm hungry.
Call room service.
Fine.
What do you want on it?
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
If I have to. I'm going to take a shower.
Did you call?
The line was busy. I'll try again.
They're not delivering. I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
Peter, you have to admit
admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Peter...
How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it?
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
For emphasis?
Exactly. It's the key.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine? Violent?
A fierce magazine... brutal... An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine... fierce... Mad.
What?
Where's the note?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces. All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse. Why?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Right. Here! c4.
Hi.
Can I come in?
The other night I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
You really haven't seen my best side.
Peter...
No, listen. You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
That's still no excuse. You treat everything like a game.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you. I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile. Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard? Ever since my wife died I've been... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again afraid of losing them.
You're wife died. You can't feel responsible for that.
You don't understand.
Then help me to understand. I want to understand.
It's not that easy.
Of course it isn't. It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
This letter. I've never opened it.
Why not?
Because I know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be. He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
It could be anything.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Frank told me.
No he didn't.
You're right. The killer told me.
He didn't tell you either.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
Of course not.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah. I'll be there later.
You beat him.
I got lucky.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you. You made a difference.
It's over now.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Do we have a future?
Hello, Peter. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your Queen at b5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82. I'm glad it helped you.
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good. That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm not nervous.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week.
Me too.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Well, you're beautiful.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I can't.
I lied.
About what?
I can't wait either.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Colwyn.
Have they harmed you?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
I will find you. I will be with you.
I know it.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Colwyn. Colwyn. I love you, Colwyn.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
All the passages are guarded.
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Take the western passage.
All directions are the same here.
Yes.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
I knew you would come.
Lyssa ...
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
In the Arctic ice.
That way. I can feel the cold.
That's a better one.
Yes.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
Of course it was.
They have Lyssa!
You can't reach her! Through the door. Quickly!
You will go alone.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command! You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
The White Castle has fallen.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My forefather was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Your powers are greater than you know. Have you ever seen one of these?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.
But there is another entrance to this place.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You won't have to.
There is nothing.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
The Fortress moves?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
You have not slept in two days.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
You choose these?
Yes. They will be more help than highborn barons.
They know when they're going to die?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors. Wait.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I will find her!
I cannot reach her.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Yes.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa. Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
From here, I must go alone.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
You must never know her name. If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
Let us wish him peace.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
The Beast will kill her.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
She must make a glaive.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
The spiral begins in the west.
Where the spiral begins.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
How did you know?
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Slayers!
We must enter the swamp.
Do not let the waters touch you.
What will happen?
They can be saddled.
You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.
Saddles.
It is today?
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I don't think that.
Am I not worth returning to?
Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
Even by you?
Yes.
You too are lonely.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
You will not, then?
I cannot.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death. Where is this place?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
What business?
Staying alive.
Once is enough, thank you.
He saved our lives.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
I was hoping I might be your friend.
My <u>friend</u>.
I have need of friends.
No more, my lord my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
You and I will guard the fire.
What else is left for a man without friends.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
Fame? Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I know you.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes. Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crowfood, tell me why I am going to follow you.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm all right.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Well, I'm not impressed.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
You've eaten nothing.
We must try to get horses.
Yes. It will double our range. I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
These we'll pay for.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Hand over your dinner.
A flicker of talent.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Go, join them.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Go. I command you.
Yes, my lord.
We could reach it on firemares.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
At the gallop!
You're resourceful, my lad. I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Naturally.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Nothing worse than lowerclass boors with upperclass morals.
Would you settle for a boar?
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
You!
Me. May I eat with you tonight?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life. I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
I am Quell.
What is that awful looking place?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I'm glad. I'm very glad.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
No.
A venison pie as big as a house.
A small house.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you oneeyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
Quell?
I cannot go with you, my friend.
My heart stays here.
And mine goes with you.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
You can have half.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision.
I ... ... am Titch.
I'm hungry.
Smart lad. Bring me my spices!
If I could wish ... ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ... ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
I'd wish for a puppy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your oneeyed friend.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
I don't think it's working.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ... What? Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air? Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
It's right behind you.
We meant only to please you.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Oh, she was so beautiful and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Would you desert your friends?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
Put me down, you lout!
You had better manners as a pig.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
Food for crows.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Oh, my poor stew!
Oh, my poor stomach.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Hush!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Look at its insides.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little. Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin. Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ... ... short in stature ... ... tall in power ... ... narrow of purpose ... ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He is the King.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ... ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
They'll trample him to death!
No. He will master the leader.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
Then look!
It's a lie!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not!
Then he will die!
He will come for me.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
It is important to assure the succession.
Yes.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
That I am, my lady.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
You were attacked in the forest?
Yes. We lost five.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
How many did you lose?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Modred! Impossible!
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It is the time.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Can you see?
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here. We'll find her.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
Many have perished in that maze.
No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Yes. Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Her name is Death.
She had another name once.
Few have survived it.
Fewer will survive them.
Each to his fate, lad.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Look.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Kegan!
It is too late. He has drunk.
Go now. Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
That is true.
Who speaks that name!
Ynyr!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
I killed him when he was born. This place is my punishment.
Do not try your trickery on me!
It is no trickery.
Those are reflections. <u>This</u> is my face!
You see?
Yes.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
No.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
It will not help.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
I cannot stop the sand.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
You will come with me.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
What's that man's name?
Why do you want to know?
He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in. But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?
...What?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good... But what's special in him?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
It's better... You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf. I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Yes.
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
That's what I later told myself! No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Do you need money?
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
No, no.
Pay attention to women, Leon. They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Why can't I have a bank account?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu. That's why you can't have a bank account!
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
OK, I'm fine.
Good.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
How can you say it?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5. You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Rocket launcher.
Oh really? But can you miss the car?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
Who'll I aim at?
Whoever.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Perfect.
Good! First shot!
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
The yellow and pink.
OK.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Yes, yes...
It's incredible! How did you do it?
What?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
OK.
Come on, get down!
You were scared, weren't you?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
...Because I feel it.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Yes.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now. You said I learn very quickly.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
May I go to the cinema?
No.
For musicals? That's part of the job!
No, you can't go out.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Not taken.
Why?
Too heavy.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
I never rent my gear.
If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed? ...Then? Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...I'm going to kiss you.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
What?
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK. I love you anyway.
Mathilda?!
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...17.
...Shit!! We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
What shall we do?
I think.
Where are you going?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...Why didn't he close the window?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
There are better things. You see the importance of the "moment". Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it. This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...Later.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
...I prefer apartments... Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
It's too big.
Yeah... I'm just good for leftovers!
Risky business, isn't it?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
I love you so much, Leon.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you? Are you OK?
Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it?
...Don't you drink?
I prefer waiting for a while... I feel it would go the wrong way.
...No...
...Don't you like me?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I don't know.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked. I'm used to this! My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it! And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago. Before coming here, in my country. I was 14yearold... We flirted like kids... Her father didn't want her to meet me. My family was not very respectable.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway?
...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony. ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city... And never had another girlfriend...
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.
Three times, then two times.
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yeah, what?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
It will take them five minutes! How long ago did they arrive?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Mathilda, listen!
No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want!
You say it just to calm me!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Yes?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh! You made an error, baby. I don't know any Danielle.
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
...Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
...One second.
Don't fear.
I have no fear.
How are you, Miss?
Fine...
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh? That's smart!
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true. But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
...No... he's my lover...
You can't sit here like that.
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay. It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...And how much is it?
Ten dollars... A month.
...OK... Good.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi... What region do you come from?
Messina.
Emilio? Due grappe! ...Why the hell did you come here?
But... He works for your same employer?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
...Who sent you?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Is he still alive?
Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Yes... Twice.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
No...
It's a specialty down there. It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always. It's the only important thing in the world.
...Yeah.
Salute.
Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you. Norman smiles.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result. It's right this that makes me nervous, now. I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Then...
Do you recognize him?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
These guys have no place. They change virtually everyday. And his name... It's a surname.
He probably just went somewhere.
Where?
For a walk. I don't know.
What is it?
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Hightop Nike CrossTrainers with heel support and aircushioned soles. They're nasty.
And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams?
I have new dreams now.
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Uncle Maurice I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me. Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country Gerald and I will come along
I have to walk by myself all the way every inch.
It's impossible.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
What if you don't make it?
I'll make it.
If you really want to do this... plan it out. Rest up. Train for it. Build up your body. Plan every stop along the way. How much money? Time? Really do it properly. This is all so by the seat of your pants.
No it's not.
Why did you take the back roads here? They're not safe. You'd know that if you'd planned.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousandfive hundred miles in your present condition?
Nothing's going to happen.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children. They're really special.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
How serious is it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
What?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done. Finished. You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there.
I have to finish first.
I won't let you die.
What would you like us to do?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law. He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
We're very sorry about that. Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression. It is a time when an individual will act overconfident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
How long does this... Mania last?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently. If I get any information, I'll call you.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone. If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Mine.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Are you a preacher?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
This is Indiana nothing's going to happen to you.
You need a ride, Preacher?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife? Crushed her like a bug. Snapped her bones?
That's enough.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again... Tell me something. Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her? Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face
I'll kill you!
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. This is called, "Claudication," As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body. That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Can it kill me?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
What steps do we take now?
We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What are the odds? Do I have a fiftyfifty chance of surviving the operation?
It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very highrisk situation.
So what's the deal Maurice?
Pardon?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit usually it takes gun point to get you in here...
Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy?
Yes you are.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
I know what you're getting at.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You have?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Okay.
You should start slow and easy fifteen minutes a day.
No. How far in one attempt what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
I don't know maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Twenty miles? I see.
Yes?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
You thought I sent them?
There was no card.
Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day?
It's just a regular day.
It's a special day isn't it?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes Maurice I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Ellen?
What?
The new store?
Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
It's a tremendous amount of work moving.
We can do it together.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What's that? That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune. What you have is a statement.
What it is is the truth.
I don't follow.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You don't think I love you?
I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
Yes.
Anything?
What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that.
No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
You're talking to me?
Why do you polish it?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone?
No.
Then why?
There's no reason.
Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
I do love you... very, very much.
Show me.
I will I promise.
Walk with me?
You like to take walks?
No. But I want to take a walk with you.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Please tell me.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I've changed my mind.
You can't change your mind.
I want children.
You've just decided, is that right?
Yes.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
You can change.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Don't be so sure.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Don't bring it in here it probably has all kinds of diseases.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
It'll make it.
Your father?
He's plastered.
That's okay really it is.
No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone.
I don't know.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Did you have a dream?
I know where my heaven is.
Where?
Pacifica, California.
Why there?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Maurice?
Yes.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Go to sleep Ellen.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Good.
What did they ask?
If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
To where?
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I see.
Why?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Most certainly.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
That's a reasonable assumption.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts? About what?
About my love for her.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
What's his story?
His name is Maurice. He's dancing around everything else.
Red flag, man.
If he's in trouble with the law fine. Not our problem. He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Red flags man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague? Why so evasive? He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
This guy's not a murderer.
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jackasses.
A marriage certificate? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home. Why?
Hansen's whipped. Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
PARKER. Right. Get on the horn with Philly. Call me here.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
That's all right isn't it?
Shit! He jumped!
Jumped where?
Out of the car. He jumped out of the god damn car!
Well, hello.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Is that right?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Yeah!
I thought you were asleep.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
You tell stories?
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Who's telling this story?
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
That's me.
Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. The end.
You know what that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Making the grand total?
Damn baby, relax. I'm getting to it. From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What was that?
Perhaps there's another route?
This is the route approved by triple A. Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
By car right?
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
What are you saying? This story is too big for this paper?
Umm, no. It's just that
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Maybe.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett... Pride and Prejudice.
You're amazing.
It has to be a full character's name.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book... Sorry I was late. My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Pulitzer, here I come.
What happened?
Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I want to reach people. Nobody listens to me. This is my way to reach them.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things. How can you feel for dog food? The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town. Nothing ever happens.
Write from your heart. That's why the classics are great.
Are you firing me?
No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.
Where?
California.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
I'm walking there Kris.
Walking where?
California.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
I always knew you had good instincts... Goodbye Kris. I'll see you when I get back.
Phileas Fogg?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I told you.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city. That's good.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
She knew you loved her.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Why know?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
So I've been informed.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles... And you know what Kris?
What Mr. Parker?
She never ate a slice.
Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You're amazing.
I missed you Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well. The Crusader for social issues and all.
You were right. From the heart is always better.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors. I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Are they standing?
Saluting.
Come on Mr. Parker.
What, come on?
I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help. But I'm not risking your life.
It's mine to risk.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
No more words. Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Which hospital? Did you take me back?
What do your friends call you?
Steph.
Do you have a car, Steph?
You're in pain.
I need your help.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good. I've been following your story for a long while. It's a beautiful thing you did.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
... My father.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Oh, that's not mine.
I don't have kids.
You should. Children are a blessing from God. I have four.
You look so happy how long have you been married?
Fortyseven years.
Where did he go?
He's getting my sweater from the car. I said there was a breeze. I told him not to go.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Yes.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What do you mean?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What's your shoe size?
What? Who are you?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Evening News?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
It's yours.
No. I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch I can see that.
I really want that watch.
This isn't right.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It really isn't that much.
